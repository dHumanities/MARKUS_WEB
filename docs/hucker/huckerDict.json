The term is one of the commonest in Chinese official nomenclature, occurring in all eras, in many types of agencies,at virtually every level of rank. It very seldom appears as the first character in a title, but among such instances is a most important one: ch‘eng-hsiang (Counselor-in-chief, Grand Councilor). Except in a context listing the various officials of an agency, it almost never occurs by itself as a complete title, although in S. Sung the prestigious title ch’eng-hsiang was formally shortened to the simple ch’eng alone. Normally ch‘eng occurs as the final character in a title, preceded by the name of an agency or by a phrase suggesting a specialized function. Its sense is almost always Aide in ..., Aide to ..., or Aide for the ch’eng was almost invariably at a secondary or tertiary level of authority’ albeit sometimes with executive authority of importance. His rank was normally in the middle or lower ranges of the hierarchy. His role was normally that of an administrative assistant to the head of an agency, but his function may at times be better suggested by renderings such as Assistant Director, Assistant Magistrate,or even Vice .... E.g., shang-hai hsien ch’eng might literally mean Aide (to the Magistrate) of Shanghai District, but his function might be better suggested by the rendering Vice Magistrate of Shanghai District. Care is always called for to determine, e.g., that the ch’ang-an shih ch’eng of Han times was not an Aide in the Ch’ang-an Marketplaces but was Aide for the Ch’ang-an Marketplaces to the Metropolitan Governor (ching-chao yin), or that the ku-ch’ui ch’eng found in government from the era of N-S Division through Sung times was neither Aide to the Drummers and Fifers nor Aide for Drums and Fifes to someone, but in the Sung dynasty, e.g., was quite like an Assistant Director under a Director (ling) of the Drum and Fife Service (ku-ch’ui chü) in the Imperial Music Office (ta-sheng fu). Especially from Han through Sung times, ch’eng commonly played a secondary role below Directors (ling) and were often in pairs’ prefixed Left and Right.

Created in 1376 by transformation of the early Ming Branch Secretariats (hsing chung-shu sheng) in the Yüan pattern, each sharing control over its jurisdiction with a Provincial Surveillance Commission (t’i-hsing an-ch’a shih ssu) and a Regional Military Commission (tu chih-hui shih ssu) and in a close cooperative relationship with a Region\" Inspector (hsün-an yü-shih) delegated from the Censorate (yü-shih t’ai till 1380, then tu ch’a-yüan). From the 1400s these provincial authorities were gradually subordinated to the supervision of Grand Coordinators (hsün-fu) and then multi-province Supreme Commanders (tsung-tu) delegated from the central government on special duty assignments. In Ch,ing the Regional Military Commission was superseded by Manchu Generals (chiang-chün) of the Banner system (see pa ch’i) and Provincial Military Commanders (t’i-tU) of Green Standards (lu-y’ng) forces; and Ming’s supervisory Grand Coordinators and Supreme Commanders evolved into Governors and Governors-general, respectively, entrenched in the regular territorial administration to such an extent that the Provincial Administration Commissions became their staff agencies for administration, with less prestige than in Ming times. In the mature Ming system there were 13 such Commissions; none existed for the 2 Metropolitan Areas around the capitals Peking (Chih-li from 1421) and Nanking (Nan Chih-li from 1421), for which Administration Commission functions were extended from neighboring Provinces. Under Ch’ing, in 1661 2 Provincial Administration Commissions were established for the old Southern Metropolitan Area (since the fall of Ming called Chiang-nan) in the creation of modern Kiangsu and Anhwei Provinces; in 1663 old Shensi was similarly divided into Shensi and Kansu; in 1664 old Hukwang was divided into Hupei and Hunan; in 1724 a Provincial Administration Commission was established for the Metropolitan Area (Chih-li) around Peking; and in 1760 separate Commissions were established for the two natural parts of heavily populated, wealthy, and still united Kiangsu Province, one based at Soochow and called the Kiangsu Provincial Administration Commission, the other based at Nanking and called the Chiang-ning Provincial Administration Commission. Thus there were 20 such Commissions in the mature Ch’ing order. In both dynasties the principal post was that of Commissioner (shih, pu-cheng shih), rank 2b; there were normally 2 appointees, one prefixed Left and one prefixed Right, until 1667, but only one was appointed thereafter. In each Commission there were variable numbers of Administration Vice Commissioners (ts’an-cheng), 3b, and Assistant Administration Commissioners (ts’an-i), 4b; such supportive agencies as a Registry (ching-li ssu), a Records Office (chao-mo so), an Office of the Judicial Secretary (lì-wen so), Granaries (ts’ang), and Storehouses (k’u); and in Ming but not Ch’ing a Miscellaneous Manufactures Service (tsa-tsao chü), a Weaving and Dyeing Service (chih-jan chü), and a Prison Office (ssu-yü ssu). Vice Commissioners and Assistant Commissioners were normally assigned to Branch Offices (fen-ssu) of the Commissions, given the generic designation Circuit Intendants (tao-fax). Commissions had from 3 to 8 all-purpose General Administration Circuits (fen-shou tao), each exercising all the authority of the Commissioner(s) in a geographically defined part of the Province; and there were many kinds of specialized, function-specific Circuits, e.g.,Tax Intendant Circuits (tu-liang tao), Census Intendant Circuits (tu-ts’e tao). In 1735 all such Circuit Intendant duty assignments were transformed into regular, substantive positions in their own right, removed from their nominal associations with the Provincial Administration Commissions. For the most part, however, Circuit Intendants continued to function as intermediaries between Prefectures and the Commissions, as before.

In (Jurchen) Chin: one, rank 5b, on the staff of the Court Ceremonial Institute (hsüan-hui yüan), perhaps without the traditional \"speaking official” functions. In Yüan: 2, rank 4a, attached to the Censorate (yü-shih t’ai), deprived of their traditional functions except keeping the Imperial Diary.

","(2) T’ANG-CHIN: Military Commissioner, a military title of great historical importance. Originated in the late 600s as a common variant reference to Area Commanders (tu-tu), military officers in charge of frontier defenses. Beginning in 711, Military Commissioners were regularly appointed to head 8 Defense Commands (chen) along the northern frontier instead of Area Commanders, and soon some Prefects (tz’u-shih) also took the new title. Especially in consequence of the An Lu-shan rebellion beginning in 756, the number of Military Commissioners proliferated, and during much of the late T’ang period they were virtually autonomous regional governors. Theoretically, control over a Circuit (tao) came to be divided between a Military Commissioner and, for non-military affairs, a Surveillance Commissioner (kuan-ch’a shih); but in many Circuits a warlord took both functions for himself, as Military and Surveillance Commissioner (chieh-tu kuan-ch’a shih), and often in addition status as Revenue Commissioner (tu-chih shih), Agriculture Commissioner (ying-t’ien shih), Bandit-suppression Commissioner (chao-t’ao shih), etc. The Military Commissioners commonly designated their lieutenants Military Vice Commissioners (chieh-tu fu-shih). Princes (wang) were sometimes designated Mil-Commissioners-in-chief (chieh-tu ta-shih), often assisted by Military Vice Commissioners-in-chief (chieh-tu fu ta-shih), but they remained on duty in the capital. During the Five Dynasties era Military Commissioners continued as virtually autonomous satraps in their regions, but Sung gradually eliminated them and achieved a consolidation of authority in the central government. After the earliest Sung years, the title Military Commissioner was used only as an honorific designation for a few distinguished personages or as a title conferred on submissive aboriginal chieftains. In Liao there were Military Commissioners in charge of most Prefectures (chou) and Military Prefectures (chün), under the control of the Southern Administration (nan-mien). In Chin all civil and military affairs of Defense Commands (chen) were controlled by Military Commissioners, who held rank 3b. In Yüan times regional military authority was organized in new ways and divided among such dignitaries as Military Commanders (yüan-shuai) of Circuits (tao), Route Commanders (... lu tsung-kuan), etc. RR+SP: commissaire impérial au commandement d’une région.

In Sung, c. 1020, an independent Remonstrance Bureau (chien-yüan) was established; some modern historians interpret this development as an effort to deflect Remonstrance Officials’ attention and efforts away from the ruler toward the Grand Councilors (tsai-hsiang),to whom they were no longer subordinate. From Yüan on, except for a brief revival of the Remonstrance Bureau in the 1380s, special Remonstrance Officials were not appointed and remonstrance functions became added responsibilities of Censors (yü-shih), who had previously been limited in general to maintaining watch over the officialdom and impeaching wayward officials, as Surveillance Officials (ch’a-kuan).

CL: le cinquième degré de la subordination administrative; garde-magasin. ","(4) N-S DIV (N. Dyn.)- T’ANG: common abbreviated reference to Garrison, a unit of c. 1,000 soldiers in the Garrison Militia system (see fu-ping). The organizational development of these militia units, which were especially esteemed in the first T’ang century, was very complex but can be summarized as follows: The successive alien Wei dynasties that dominated North China in the 400s and 500s originally segregated their own peoples in such Garrisons scattered throughout their territories and eventually accepted (finally conscripted) Chinese as well into Garrison service. The Garrisons grew from an originally authorized 100 to more than 600 by early T’ang. In Sui each Garrison was controlled by a Cavalry General (p’iao-chi chiang-chün) assisted by a Chariot and Horse General (ch’e-chi chiang-chün), each subject to the control of one of Twelve Guards (shih-erh wei) at the dynastic capital, to which militiamen were rotated for service. By 607 the Garrisons had apparently split into 2 types, a Cavalry Garrison (p’iao-chi fu) and a Chariot and Horse Garrison (ch’e-chi fu), each with a correspondingly designated General; for in that year the 2 types were consolidated into a single standard type, a Soaring Hawk Garrison (ying-yang fu) with a Commandant (lang-chiang) and a Vice Commandant (fu lang-chiang). In 613, for reasons not clear, some additional Garrisons were separately established with the names Assault-resisting Garrison (che-ch’ung fu) and Courageous Garrison (kuo-ifu), each with a Commandant (tu-wei). At the beginning of T’ang in 618, briefly, the Commandants and Vice Commandants of the Soaring Hawk Garrisons were retitled Military Chief (chün-í’ou), rank 4a2, and Garrison Assistant (fu-fu), 5a1, respectively; but before year’s end the Soaring Hawk Garrisons were all again named Cavalry Garrisons or Chariot and Horse Garrisons, each with a General (chiang-chün). At the same time similar military units were created in the household of the Heir Apparent, as Guard Commands (shuai-fu). In 619 (623?) the Cavalry Garrisons and Chariot and Horse Garrisons were consolidated into one type, Assault-resisting Garrisons, with Commandants (tu-wei) and Vice Commandants (fu lang-chiang). (The Assault-resisting and Courageous Garrisons established in 613 had apparently disappeared with Sui.) In 624 all Garrisons were renamed Commander-generals’ Garrisons (t’ung-chün fu) and were headed by Commander-generals (t’ung-chün) and Adjunct Commandants (pieh-chiang, also called fu t’ung-chün). Finally, in 636 the militia Garrisons were renamed Assault-resisting Garrisons, each having one Commandant (tu-wei), rank 4a1, 4b2, or 5a2 depending on the number of militiamen in the Garrison; one each Left and Right Vice Commandant (kuo-i tu-wei), 5b2, 6a1,or 6a2; and one Adjunct Commandant (pieh-chiang, 7a2, 7b1, or 7b2. The Garrisons were graded as Large (shang), Medium (chung), or Small (hsia) according to the size of their militiamen contingents. For purposes of rotating personnel in and out of the military units at the dynastic capital,Garrisons were all affiliated with or subordinate to the Sixteen Guards (shih-liu wei, q.v.). RR: milice. ","(5) T’ANG-YÜAN: Superior Prefecture, a unit of territorial administration comparable to an ordinary Prefecture (chou) but in a specially honored or strategic location such as the environs of a capital city; normally headed by a high-ranking dignitary entitled Prefectural Governor (mu or yin). RR+SP: préfecture supérieure.

The Ministry was subdivided into Bureaus (ssu) in Sui, T’ang, and Sung, with minor variations: e.g., in T’ang a Bureau of Judicial Administration (hsing-pu, hsing-pu ssu), a Criminal Administration Bureau (tu-kuan, tu-kuan pu, tu-kuan ssu), a Bureau of Review (pi-pu, pi-pu ssu), and a Bureau of Frontier Control (ssu-men, ssu-men ssu), each headed by a Director (lang, lang-chung)’ rank 5b.

Successor of the tu-chih (Ministry of Revenue) of the era of N-S Division and of the Sui-early T’ang min-pu, retitled c. 650 to avoid the personal name of T’ang T’ai-tsung (Li Shih-min); T’ang writers extended this taboo back to Sui, erroneously referring to Sui’s min-pu as a hu-pu. The Ministry was in general charge of population and land censuses, assessment and collection of taxes, and storage and distribution of government revenues. Usually divided into specialized Bureaus (ssu, ch’ing-li ssu; also see ts’ao): a Census Bureau (hu-pu, ssu-yüan, ti-kuan), a General Accounts Bureau (tu-chih, ssu-tu), a Treasury Bureau (chin-pu, ssu-chen, ssu-chin), and a Granaries Bureau (ts’ang-pu, ssu-yü, ssu-ch’u).

In Ming and Ch’ing, Bureaus were named on the basis of territorial jurisdictions, one per Province (sheng), each Bureau directing and monitoring fiscal administration in the Province for which it was named. In Ming each such Bureau had 4 subsidiary Sections (k’o) with functional specializations: a Statistics Section (min-k’o), a General Accounts Section (tu-chih k’o), a Special Accounts Section (chin-k’o), and a Granaries Section (ts’ang-k’o). The Ministry was always headed by a Minister (shang-shu), rank 3a to 1b; Bureaus were headed by Directors (lang-chung), 6b to 5a; Sections were normally headed by Clerks (ling-shih), unranked.

The state transferred the burden of acquiring and delivering grain to the frontier onto the merchant class’ by restricting trade in salt (a state monopoly) only to those merchants who made deliveries of grain at the frontier garrisons. For each unit of grain delivered, a merchant received a salt certificate worth a specified amount of salt, payable principally at state Salt Depots (yen-ts’ang) in the central coastal region of East China. Since salt distribution was highly profitable, and since transporting grain from the rich Yangtze delta area to the northern frontier was no easier for private merchants than for the government, enterprising merchants soon lured farmers into tenancy on Merchant Farms (shang-t’un) close behind the frontier garrisons, which produced the grain needed to obtain salt certificates. The system was an important element in Ming fiscal arrangements into the 1420s’ after which the development of a state transport system based on the newly reconstructed Grand Canal, together with gradual resettlement and economic development in the northern provinces, made the Equitable Exchange less important; but it remained an element of the frontier supply system into the 1600s. The Ming system was inspired by, though not directly copied from, the Sung dynasty Equitable Exchange of Rice for Salt (chung-yen; also see che-chung ts’ang) instituted in the reign of Sung T’ai-tsung (976-997), involving state payments in salt for the delivery of rice to the capital."]},"3101":{"id":"3101","page":"p274","pingYin":"","term":"開藩","explanation":["SUNG: lit., to open (a headquarters) in a frontier zone: Regional Supervisor, a general term referring to Military Commissioners (chieh-tu shih), Pacification Commissioners (ch’eng-hsüan shih, hsüan-yü shih), etc."]},"3102":{"id":"3102","page":"p274","pingYin":"","term":"開坊","explanation":["MING-CH’ING: lit., to break free of the Secretariat, referring to the Secretariat of the Heir Apparent (ch’un-fang); officials promoted out of the Secretariat commonly moved steadily into high ministerial posts in the central government, so that \"breaking free of the Secretariat\" was considered desirable."]},"3103":{"id":"3103","page":"p275","pingYin":"k’āi-fü ","term":"開府","explanation":["Lit., to open an office, implying the creation of one’s own staff.

An advantage of the system from the central governments viewpoint was that it mingled officers and soldiers who had no prior or future personal affiliations that might lead to regional warlordism. It was claimed, however, that the result was low morale and poor leadership in the field. In 1074 the system was discontinued. It was replaced with a network of permanent garrisons, ideally with about 3,000 soldiers each, established in all strategic places, each under the control of a permanently assigned Area General (chiang) who was responsible for training his professional career soldiers and, as necessary, leading them in battle. Such garrisons quickly totaled 92. The Area Generals were commonly called Circuit Generals (lu-chiang) and were apparently prefixed with the names of the Circuits (lu) in which their garrisons were located; but the number of such garrisons far exceeded that of the normal Sung administrative realms called Circuits, so that, e.g., the Ho-pei Circuit included the garrisons of 17 Area Generals. The Area Generals were under the supervisory jurisdiction of the Bureau of Military Affairs (shu-mi yüan); their organizational relationship wiA various Circuit authorities (see chien-ssu) is not clear.

Prior to Sui often named Personnel Section (lì-pu ts’ao). For a time in the late 1200s, in Yüan, when traditional Ministries were consolidated in new forms, was absorbed first into a Personnel and Rites Ministry (li-li pu) and then into a Ministry of Personnel, Revenue, and Rites (li-hu-li pu), also known in the aggregate as the Left Ministry (tso-pu; also see yu-pu); but by 1294 regained its separate identity, though tightly coordinated by the metropolitan Secretariat. In general charge of the appointments, merit ratings, promotions, demotions, titles, and honors of civil officials (wen-kuan) and subofficial functionaries (li); in early Sung also handled appointments, etc., of military officers (wu-kuan), who in other times were the responsibility of the Ministry of War (ping-pu). From the outset headed by one or more Ministers (shang-shu), rank 3a in T’ang, 2b in Sung, 3a in Chin and Yüan, 2a in Ming and Ch’ing till 1730, thereafter 1b; in Ch’ing one Manchu and one Chinese appointee; commonly took ceremonial precedence over all other Ministry heads. In the era of N-S Division the Ministry was subdivided into Bureaus (ssu) or Sections (ts’ao): e.g., in San-kuo Wei an Appointments Section (li-pu ts’ao, li-pu; see #2 below), a Discipline Section (shan-ting ts’ao), a Section for the Three Dukes (san-kung ts’ao; see san kung), and a Review Section (pi-pu ts’ao). Thereafter the subordinate agencies varied greatly in number and designations, and when designated Bureaus they often had numerous Sections subordinate to them. From Sui on, however, the standard organization of the Ministry included 4 Bureaus (ssu, ch’ing-li ssu) Bureau of Appointments (li-pu ssu, wen-hsüan ssu), Bureau of Honors (ssu-feng ssu, yen-feng ssu), Bureau of Merit Titles (ssu-hsün ssu, chi-hsün ssu), and Bureau of Evaluations (k’ao-kung ssu). Each Sui-Ch’ing Bureau was normally headed by a Director (lang-chung, lang), rank 6b to 5a. In Chin all Bureaus of the Ministry were consolidated into 2, a Bureau of Evaluations (tzu-k’o ssu) and a Bureau of Honors (feng-hsün ssu), each a petty agency managed by a Secretary (chu-shih), rank 7b, although a pretence was maintained that the traditional 4 Bureaus still existed. In Yüan the Ministry’s nominal Bureaus were inactive, their traditional work being done by 3 Sections (k’o) of much lesser status: an Honors Section (feng-kao k’o), a Section for Honors and Enfeoffments (hsün-feng k’o), and an Evaluations and Selections Section (k’ao-hsüan k’o), each managed by an unranked Clerk (ling-shih). Until 1380 in Ming, the Ministry was considered so dependent on the Secretariat that its head was commonly referred to as Minister of Personnel in the Secretariat (chung-shu li-pu shang-shu); after 1380 its relative autonomy was indicated by the simpler title Minister of Personnel (li-pu shang-shu).

In Sung fields of specialization were much more numerous; the Presented Scholar degree predominated, the term “other examinations” (chu-k’o) supplementing it to permit subspecializations in the general fields of law, history, rituals, and classics; and the Presented Scholar examination became so predominant from the 1070s that Metropolitan Graduate seems a more suitable rendering for the term chin-shih thereafter. ","(2) MING-CH’ING: Six Offices of Scrutiny, a cluster of major central government agencies staffed with Supervising Secretaries or Supervising Censors (both chi-shih-chung, q.v.) who were responsible for maintaining censorial surveillance over the Six Ministries (liu pu), especially for monitoring the flow of documents between the throne and the Ministries; generally independent agencies until 1723, then made constituent units in the Censorate (tu ch’a-yüan), after which Supervising Censor seems a more appropriate rendering than Supervising Secretary. Named after the Ministries for which they were separately responsible: Office of Scrutiny for Personnel (lì-k’o), for Revenue (hu-k’o), for Rites (lǐ-k’o), for War (ping-k’o), for Justice (hsing-k’o), for Works (kung-k’o). Created in 1373 as the agencies among which Supervising Secretaries were distributed, stabilized at 12 (10 from 1376), rank 7a. In 1377 made subordinate to the Directorate of Proclamations (ch’eng-ch’ih chien), in 1379 transferred to the Office of Transmission (t’ung-cheng ssu). In 1393 each Office of Scrutiny was reorganized with one Chief Supervising Secretary (tu chi-shih-chung), 8a, and one each Left and Right Supervising Secretary, 8b, providing administrative supervision over a total of 40 Supervising Secretaries, 9a. From 1399 till 1402 ranks were raised for Chief Supervising Secretaries and Supervising Secretaries to 7a and 7b, respectively, and Left and Right Supervising Secretaries were discontinued; c. 1402 Left and Right Supervising Secretaries were re-established, with rank 7b. Thereafter each Office was staffed with one Chief Supervising Secretary, 7a, one each Left and Right Supervising Secretary, 7b, and from 4 to 10 Supervising Secretaries, 7b (dwindling to from 4 to 7 in the late Ming decades). Ch’ing perpetuated the Ming system till 1660, when one each Manchu and Chinese Chief Supervising Secretary, one each Manchu and Chinese Left and Right Supervising Secretaries, and two Chinese Supervising Secretaries were prescribed in each Office. In 1665 all these posts were abolished except for one each Manchu and Chinese Supervising Secretary in each Office; but the next year one each Manchu and Chinese Seal-holding Supervising Secretary (chang-yin chi-shih-chung) were authorized as the new administrative leaders of each Office with rank at the 4 level. They were quickly dropped to the 7 level, then in 1667 restored to the 4 level, then in 1670 made 7a and in 1729 raised to 5a. Left and Right Supervising Secretaries were no longer appointed. In 1729, after being absorbed into the Censorate, Supervising Censors rose from 7b to 5a. Thus from each of the Offices of Scrutiny, integrated into the Censorate, had one each Manchu and Chinese Seal-holding Supervising Censors and one Supervising Censor in each Office.

From the outset, the Ministries were constituent units of the Department of State Affairs (shang-shu sheng); in Yüan the Department alternated with the Secretariat (chung-shu sheng) as the supreme central government agency housing the Ministries. Ming in 1380 abolished the superstructure of the Secretariat inherited from Yüan, leaving the Six Ministries in the top echelon of the central government without coordination except by the Emperor; but in the 15th century the Ministries came to be subordinated in practice to a new coordinating institution, the Grand Secretariat (nei-ko); this situation was perpetuated by Ch’ing. Each Ministry normally had an executive staff including one Minister (ch’ing; 3 in Yüan, one each Manchu and Chinese in Ch’ing), rank 3a in T’ang, 2b in Sung, 3a in Chin and Yüan, 2a in Ming, fluctuating between 1 and 2 in early Ch’ing, then 2 from 1670, 1b from 1730; and one or, most often, 2 Vice Ministers (shih-lang), 4a2 in T’ang except that the Vice Minister of Personnel was 4a1,3b in Sung, 4a in Chin and Yüan, 3a in Ming, from 3a to 2a in Ch’ing. The Minister of Personnel was considered the senior Minister, taking ritual precedence over his counterparts in other Ministries. Each Ministry normally had 4 or more constituent Bureaus (ssu; in Ming and Ch’ing, ch’ing-li ssu but commonly abbreviated to ssu); the Bureaus normally had functional designations, e.g. k’ao-kung ssu (Bureau of Evaluations) in the Ministry of Personnel, chu k’o ssu (Bureau of Receptions) in the Ministry of Rites; but in Ming and Ch’ing times Bureaus of the Ministries of Revenue and of Justice were increased in number and given territorial designations, generally one per Province (sheng), e.g., a Shantung Bureau (shan-tung ch’ing-li ssu) in each of those 2 Ministries. Each Bureau was headed by a Director (lang-chung), occasionally more than one per Bureau, 5b in T’ang, 6a or 6b in Sung, 6b in Chin and Yüan, 5a in Ming and Ch’ing; each Bureau Director was assisted by one or more Vice Directors (yüan-waì lang), 6b1 in T’ang, 7a in Sung, 7b in Chin and Yüan, 6a in Ming and Ch’ing. The Ministries in YÜAN times did not always have constituent Bureaus but, rather, had Sections (k’o) of lesser status, designated according to functions; and the Ming Ministry of Revenue’s constituent Bureaus, with territorial designations, each had 4 subsidiary Sections (k’o) with functional specializations (see hu-pu). Various Ministries in all eras also directly controlled or indirectly supervised other agencies; e.g., the Ministry of War normally supervised the Court of the Imperial Stud (t’ai-p’u ssu).

Within the Chancellery Rear Section were 6 functionally specialized Sections (an) named in the pattern of the Six Ministries (liu pu) under the Department of State Affairs.

Deriving from a late Han practice of gathering trusted advisers into a Court of Palace Attendants (shih-chung ssu) with titles that formerly were entirely honorary, such as Palace Steward or Supervising Secretary (both chi shih-chung) and Gentleman Attendant at the Palace Gate (huang-men shih-lang), the Chancellery developed in the 4th and 5th centuries to contend with the evolving Secretariat for influence over imperial decision making; by Sui it had become one of the Five Departments (wu sheng) that dominated the central government, and in T’ang it became, with the Secretariat and the Department of State Affairs, the Three Departments (san sheng) that handled the general administration of government in the patterns described above. In early Sung, executive officials of the Chancellery and the Secretariat normally served as Grand Councilors (tsai-hsiang, ch’eng-hsiang) or Vice Grand Councilors (fu-hsiang, shao-tsai); other posts in the two agencies were collapsed into an almost functionless, combined Secretariat-Chancellery (chung-shu men-hsia sheng), and remonstrance functions were perpetuated by the creation of an autonomous Chancellery Rear Section (men-hsia hou-sheng) and a separate Remonstrance Bureau (chien-yüan). In Liao’s Southern Administration (nan-mien) the T’ang-style Three Departments were retained, but in Chin both the Chancellery and the Secretariat faded in importance and were formally abolished in 1156, the Chancellery never to be re-established despite occasional proposals in Yüan times that all of T’ang’s Three Departments be restored. In its early history, in the N. Dynasties and Sui, the Chancellery was a large organization including 6 subordinate Sections (chu): see ch’eng-men chu, shang-shih chü, shang-yao chü, fu-hsi chü, yü-fu chü, and tien-nei chü. In late Sui this large agency was reorganized into 2 units, an Office of Palace Attendants (men-hsia ssu) and an Office of the Imperial Coachman (? t’ai-p’u ssu). In T’ang the reunited Chancellery was given new names several times, from 662 to 670 being called the Eastern Pavilion (tung-t’ai), from 685 to 705 the Phoenix Pavilion (luan-t’ai), and from 713 to 717 Pavilion of Imperial Gatekeepers (huang-men t’ai), which had been an intermittent variant of men-hsia sheng in earlier times. The Chancellery originally was headed by an Adviser (na-yen; lit. [one who] submits statements) and staffed with Palace Attendants (shih-chung), Supervising Secretaries (chi-shih-chung), Imperial Gatekeepers (huang-men), Attendant Gentlemen (shih-lang),etc. In mid-Sui the post of Adviser was terminated; thereafter the Chancellery was headed by 2 shih-chung, now appropriately rendered Directors; the name of the post was occasionally changed in the late 7th and during the 8th centuries. The Directors’ rank was raised from 3a to 2a in 767 and was la in Sung. There was normally one Vice Director (shih-lang), rank 3a in T’ang, 3b in Sung; lesser officials in T’ang included counterparts of those in the Secretariat, but prefixed Left rather than Right as in the Secretariat: 2 Policy Advisers (san-chi ch’ang-shih), 3b till 764, then 3a through Sung; 4 Grand Masters of Remonstrance (chien-i ta-fu), 5a then 4b; 4 Supervising Secretaries (chi-shih-chung without any prefix; Secretariat counterparts were Secretariat Drafters, chung-shu she-jen), 5a in T’ang, 4a in Sung; 4 Imperial Diarists (ch’i-chü king), 6b1; 4 Gentlemen of the Palace Gates (ch’eng-men lang), 6b1; 6 Rectifiers of Omissions (pu-ch’üeh), 7b1; 6 Reminders (shih-i), 8b1; Supervisors of Rites (tien-i), 9b2; etc. The Chancellery normally had general supervisory authority over various lesser agencies but did not have significant constituent units after Sui.

","(2) SUNG: unofficial reference to the Hanlin Academy (han-lin yüan). ","(3) MING - CH’ING: from the 1420s to 1730, the most distinguished and influential body in the central government, like a collective prime ministership; staffed with Grand Secretaries (ta hsüeh-shih) of the Hanlin Academy detached to establish offices within the imperial palace to handle the Emperor’s paperwork, recommend decisions in response to memorials received from the officialdom, and draft and issue imperial pronouncements. Created as a small, loosely organized body of secretarial consultants after the Ming founder’s abolition in 1380 of the Secretariat’s (chung-shu sheng) executive posts, which made himself sole coordinator of the Six Ministries (liu pu) that were the administrative core of the central government. The secretarial establishment gradually grew in importance until in the 1420s it attained durable form and status. The members remained loosely organized, each designated by the Hall to which he was assigned, e.g., Grand Secretary of the Hall of Literary Profundity (wen-YÜAN ko ta hsüeh-shih); but coīlegial procedures were evolved among them, and’leadership of the Grand Secretaries, commonly numbering from 2 to 6, fell to a so-called Senior Grand Secretary (shou-fu). Since the ranks associated with their Hanlin titles were low (5a), it became standard practice for each Grand Secretary to be given concurrent nominal status as Minister (shang-shu), 2a, or Vice Minister (shih-lang), 3a, in one of the Six Ministries, especially the Ministry of Rites (lǐ-pu); and particularly esteemed Grand Secretaries eventually were awarded status among the Three Dukes (san kung), honorific posts carrying rank 1a. As the Grand Secretaries grew in importance, the former Secretariat’s Drafters (chung-shu she-jen) were attached to them as a staff agency, the Central Drafting Office (chung-shu k’o) and by 1600 the Grand Secretariat had been acknowledged in state documents as a regular, formal agency of the central government. Because, beginning in the 1400s, top-ranking Metropolitan Graduates (chin-shih) were regularly assigned to the Hanlin Academy on track ultimately to become Grand Secretaries, and because Grand Secretaries with few exceptions never had experience in the line administrative agencies of government, the officialdom at large (see under wai-ch’ao, Outer Court) naturally considered the Grand Secretaries with a certain hostility as members of the Inner Court (nei-ch’ao, nei-t’ing); and this feeling grew as Grand Secretaries found it necessary, especially in the reigns of the more reclusive Ming Emperors, to collaborate with powerful palace eunuchs to maintain contact and influence with the ruler. Hostility between the officialdom in general and the Grand Secretariat became seriously disruptive after the tenure of Chang Chü-cheng (1525-1582) as Senior Grand Secretary and interfered with the operation of the central government to the end of the Ming dynasty. Some subsequent historians have argued that the abolition of the early Ming Secretariat and the consequent rise of the Grand Secretariat were the most important institutional changes in late imperial history and foredoomed the dynasty to collapse in undisciplined partisan feuding. The Manchus originally structured the central government of their Ch’ing dynasty with Three Palace Academies (nei san yüan), the traditional Six Ministries, and the traditional Censorate (tu ch’a-yüan) in its top echelon, but in 1658 the Three Palace Academies were organized into a Hanlin Academy and a Grand Secretariat of the Ming sorts. The Ch’ing Grand Secretariat was headed by 2 Manchu and 2 Chinese Grand Secretaries (ta hsüeh-shih), commonly Princes or other nobles; and the agency was formally established at the top of the official hierarchy, as unchallengeable head of the Outer Court. But the Grand Secretariat gradually lost prestige and influence, because the determining of policy was entrusted to an unofficial organization of the Manchu ruling group, called the Deliberative Council (i-cheng ch’u), staffed with Princes and Grand Ministers (ta-ch’en) of the Imperial Household Department (nei-wu fu). When in 1730 this Deliberative Council was reorganized and formalized as an official top-echelon Council of State (chün-chi ch’u), although some Grand Secretaries as individuals became members of the Council, the Grand Secretariat as an institution slipped into the secondary role of processing paperwork concerning routine administrative business under guidelines established by the Council.

Created at the beginning of Sui by combining 2 units formerly subordinate to the Chamberlain for the Palace Revenues (shao-fu, t’ai-fu), the Palace Treasury Service (nei-fu chü) and the Palace Discipline Service (i-t’ing chü); became one of the top-echelon agencies in the central government called the Five Departments (wu sheng), but in 607 demoted to Directorate (chien) status as Directorate of Palace Domestic Service (ch’ang-ch’iu chien). In its early years the T’ang dynasty, in an apparent shift from Sui policy, rigidly confined eunuchs to this agency, requiring a special imperial warrant for any eunuch to take up a post outside the palace; and it gave eunuchs no rank higher than 4. In 621 the name ch’ang-ch’iu chien was changed to nei-shih chien, and from 662 the standard name was nei-shih sheng. Official variant names existed briefly: ssu-kung t’ai from 685 to 705 and nei-shih chien again very briefly in 754, or perhaps for a year longer. From the 750s the early T’ang restrictions on eunuch activities loosened,and through the 800s eunuchs gained almost paramount power in the central government by their dominance of such agencies as the Palace Secretariat (shu-mi yüan) and the Armies of Inspired Strategy (shen-ts’e chün), and in outlying territories with status as Military Commissioners (chieh-tu shih). In late T’ang a eunuch-dominated Court of Palace Attendants (hsüan-hui yüan) overshadowed the Palace Domestic Service in the routine administration of the palace. This trend continued during the Five Dynasties era and into Sung times, when the Palace Domestic Service became a non-eunuch, civil service agency that substantially encroached on the authority of the non-eunuch Palace Administration (tien-chung sheng) inherited from T’ang, in which some eunuchs were assigned to collaborate with civil officials. The non-eunuch Palace Domestic Service included among its constituent agencies a Palace Eunuch Service (ju-nei nei-shih sheng) in which eunuchs were organized, coexisting alongside the Court of Palace Attendants. In 1160 the Palace Eunuch Service was absorbed into the Palace Domestic Service, and this again was made a wholly eunuch organization; but it came to be overshadowed by the Court of Palace Attendants, and after Sung the name nei-shih sheng was not officially restored. Throughout its history, the Palace Domestic Service was normally headed by one or more Directors (chien), rank 3b 1 in T’ang, 3a in Sung, with the aid of Vice Directors (shao-chien); and in Sui—T’ang times its eunuch members were distributed among 6 Services (chu). In Sui this battery included a Palace Food Service (nei shang-shih chü), an Office of Female Services (i-t’ing chü), a Palace Gates Service (kung-wei chū), a Menials Service (hsi-kuan chū), a Livery Service for the Empress (nei-p’u chü), and a Palace Treasury Service (nei-fu chü). The T’ang battery differed only slightly, not including a Palace Food Service but including an Inner Quarters Service (nei-fang till 739, then nei-fang chü). Such Services were normally headed by one or 2 Directors (ling), but the Inner Quarters Service did not get a Director until 739, after having been headed by a Palace Manager (tien-nei). The Directors of these Services were normally in pairs and ranked either 7b2 or 8a2, but the Director of the Inner Quarters Service ranked 5b2. In Sung the Palace Domestic Service did not have such constituent Services but did supervise an Imperial Dispensary (yü-yao yüan) operated jointly with the Palace Administration, a Monitors Office at the East Palace Gate (nei tung-men ssu), a Certificate Validation Office (ho-t’ung p’ing-yu ssu), a Manufactory (tsao-tso so), etc. Another of its subordinate agencies was an Artisans Institute (han-lin yüan) staffed with astrologers, calligraphers, painters, and physicians, not to be confused with the Hanlin Academy (also han-lin yüan) staffed with Academicians (hisüeh-shih).","RR: département de l'intendance du palais intérieur.","SP: cour de l'intendance du palais intérieur.

About 1308 the central government ordered the circulation of coins (to supplement paper money?) but soon abandoned it because of its lack of acceptance in domestic trade. In the 1350s and 1360s, when YÜAN was steadily losing ground to rebel movements, another attempt to circulate coins failed. Nevertheless, the Supervisorate of Paper Money was apparently overshadowed after 1350 by the Supervisorate-in-chief of Coinage (pao-ch’üan t’i-chu ssu), which oversaw a much larger establishment including branches throughout the country. Both agencies, despite the specificity of their names, seem to have been authorized to handle both paper money and coins. The Supervisorate of Paper Money probably oversaw other agencies in the dynastic capital, the Chief Paper Money Depository (pao-ch’ao tsung-k’u), the Paper Money Printshop (yin-tsao pao-ch’ao k’u), and 2 Paper Money Incinerators (shao-ch’ao k’u) prefixed Eastern and Western, all with Overseers and Commissioners-in-chief (ta-shih) in charge.

Produced copper coins on order of the central government and according to designs issued by the Ministry of Works (kung-pu), which maintained a counterpart Metropolitan Coinage Service (pao-yüan chü) at the dynastic capital; from 1380 coinage was specifically made the responsibility of the Ministry of Works, whereas the production and circulation of paper money was assigned to the Ministry of Revenue (hu-pu) see pao-ch’ao t’i-chü ssu (Supervisorate of Paper Money). The early history of the Ming coinage organizations was confused even in contemporary sources; the terms pao-yüan and pao-ch’üan were often used interchangeably, and agencies were often referred to vaguely as the Service (chü without any prefix) or by descriptive terms such as Coinage Services (ch’ien-chü) and Minting Directorates (chu-chien). In both the dynastic capital and the Provinces, the Services seem to have had ad hoc existences, being activated when they were needed but otherwise lapsing. It is clear that there was a continuing shortage of coins through the 1400s, and in the 1500s counterfeiting became a serious problem. The people and eventually the state moved to the use of unminted silver as the principal monetary standard, in units of taels (Chinese ounces). Coins were always needed, however, and in 1576 all Provincial Administration Commissions were ordered to reactivate their Coinage Services. Coins were minted at the capital and in the Provinces to the end of the dynasty, though such production was overshadowed from 1625 by that undertaken by the Ministry of Revenue (see #2 following). ","(2) MING: Coinage Service of the Ministry of Revenue, established at Peking in 1625 to increase the money supply needed for the costly Ming defense efforts against the Manchus, and probably also for the personal advantage of the notorious eunuch dictator Wei Chung-hsien and his henchmen. Headed by a special, supernumerary Right Vice Minister of Revenue (hu-pu yu shih-lang), rank 3a, with the duty designation Vice Minister Supervisory Manager of Coinage (tu-li ch’ien-fa shih-lang), whose post was commonly called the Coinage Office (ch’ien-fa t’ang); he substantially increased the number of mints in the capital and vigorously sought raw materials throughout the country. ","(3) CH’ING: Metropolitan Coinage Service in the pattern of (2) preceding; an agency of the Ministry of Revenue which, in cooperation with the Metropolitan Coinage Service (pao-yüan chü) maintained by the Ministry of Works, was expected to oversee the production and circulation of copper coins throughout the country. Each of the 2 Ministries for this purpose set up a Coinage Office (ch’ien-fa t’ang). (For the Ministry of Works agency, see under both ch’ien-fa t’ang and pao-yüan chü) The Ministry of Revenue’s Service was headed originally by one Chinese and one Manchu Superintendent (chien-tu), assisted by one Chinese technician called Commissioner-in-chief (ta-shih). Posts as Superintendents were filled in 2-year rotations by officials on special duty assignments from substantive posts in Bureaus (ch’ing-li ssu) of any of the Six Ministries (liu pu), but the Commissioners-in-chief were always chosen from among the unranked Clerks (pi-t’ieh-shih) of the Ministry of Revenue itself to serve 5-year terms on rotational schedules monitored by the Ministry of Personnel (lì-pu); a successful term might lead to promotion into the civil service officialdom. In 1726 the Service created 4 immediately subordinate Coinage Depots (pao-ch’üan ch’ang), each staffed with one Chinese Commissioner-in-chief. From 1729 on, however, only Manchus were approved for service as Commissioners-in-chief in the Service. The Metropolitan Coinage Services of both Ministries of Revenue and Works seem to have cooperated in giving some leadership if not specific direction to Provincial Coinage Services (generic name ch’ien-chü). However, these were more closely associated with the various Provincial Administration Commissions (ch’eng-hsüan pu-cheng shih ssu) and were staffed with 2nd level executive officials of appropriate Prefectures (fu).

Despite government recognition of unminted silver as the monetary standard in the mid-1500s, the need for coins remained, and severe shortages of coins were regularly reported. In 1576 all Coinage Services, Metropolitan and Provincial, were ordered into active operation. After 1625,however, the Ministry of Works’ primacy in coinage matters was undermined by the Ministry of Revenue’s establishment of its own Coinage Service (pao-ch’üan chü) with a special, supernumerary Vice Minister of Revenue (hu-pu shih-lang), 3a, serving as Supervisory Manager of Coinage (tu-li ch’ien-fa). From 1421 to the end of Ming, there was another Metropolitan Coinage Service (pao-yüan chü) at Nanking under the Nanking Ministry of Works, intended to serve the coinage needs of the Province-size region around Nanking. In Ch’ing, the late Ming situation was perpetuated; the Ministry of Revenue’s Metropolitan Coinage Service (pao-ch’üan chü) was established in 1644, the Ministry of Works’ counterpart (pao-yüan chü) soon thereafter. Each of these Ministries maintained a Coinage Office (ch’ien-fa t’ang) to which the 2 Metropolitan Coinage Services were subordinate. The Ministry of Works’ Office was headed by a Right Vice Minister Supervisory Manager (tu-li ch’ien-fa t’ang yu shih-lang), originally a Chinese but from 1679 on supplemented by a Manchu equal. The 2 Metropolitan Coinage Offices gave loose leadership to Provincial Coinage Services (generic name ch’ien-chu) throughout the country.

Originally a personal bodyguard (su-wei) of the founding Emperor called the Imperial Army of Original Followers (yüan-ts’ung chin-chün) or, more informally, the Hereditary army (fu-tzu chün), the Northern Command was created in 627 with the title Seven Encampments of the Northern Command (pei-ya ch’i ying). These 7 groups undertook one month of active guard duty at a time, in rotation, apparently serving alongside various units of the Southern Command. In 638, renamed the Left and Right Encampments (t’un-ying), they were restaffed with men chosen from elite families who could pass rigorous tests in archery, horsemanship, weight lifting, etc., and were called the Flying Cavalrymen (fei-chi), led by Generals (chiang-chün) of the Sixteen Guards organization. Then in 662 a new reorganization transformed the Encampments into the Left and Right Forest of Plumes Armies (yü-lin chün), reviving an ancient name derived from a celestial constellation; these were staffed with expert archers chosen at least in part from among the militiamen of the Southern Command. In 710 Left and Right Militant as Dragons Armies (lung-wu chün) were established, and in 738-739 they were placed on par with the Forest of Plumes Armies, the Northern Command aggregation now being given the collective designation Four Imperial Armies (ssu chün). In 757,during the An Lu-shan rebellion of 755-763, Left and Right Armies of Inspired Militancy (shen-wu chün) were added, making a total of Six Imperial Armies (liu chün), a designation that became almost synonymous with Northern Command. These 6 units, all but destroyed during the rebellion, were soon restored at the capital as T’ang regained strength, and they, remained the core of the capital’s military establishment, commonly under the overall control of one or more Army Commissioners of the Northern Command (pei-ya chün-shih). In c. 763 Left and Right Armies of Inspired Strategy (shen-ts’e chün) were initiated as garrisons in the imperial palace grounds under the unified control of a palace eunuch entitled Palace Commissioner (chung-shih); these quickly became the special military forces of a series of influential eunuchs who, through the 800s, dominated the court and deposed Emperors as they pleased. Meantime, during the great rebellion, many transitory units were added to the Northern Command, notably including the Left and Right Awesome and Militant Armies (wei-wu chün) and the Left and Right Long Flourishing Armies (ch’ang-hsing chün); and in 787 were established the Left and Right Armies of Inspired Awesomeness (shen-wei chün). Before 800 the Northern Command was said to consist of Ten Imperial Armies (shih chün), counting the earlier Six Imperial Armies and the newer Armies of Inspired Strategy and Armies of Inspired Awesomeness. In 807 the Armies of Inspired Militancy were disbanded. Thereafter the term Six Imperial Armies was commonly understood to refer collectively to the 2 Forest of Plumes Armies, the 2 Militant as Dragons Armies, and the 2 Armies of Inspired Strategy, the latter pair remaining paramount under eunuch control almost without interruption until the end of the dynasty, despite occasional efforts to put all defense forces in the capital under the control of members of the imperial family. In both T’ang and later times, various Imperial Armies were confusingly referred to as Guards (wei), but they are to be differentiated from the Sixteen Guards of the Southern Command. In general, each of the Imperial Armies was headed by one General-in-chief (ta chiang-chün), rank 3a1 till 784 (787?), then 2a2, assisted by 2 Generals (chiang-chün; normally 3 after the mid-700s), 3a2. From 784 (787?) each was additionally assigned a Commander-general (t’ungchün), 3a1,as principal aide to the General-in-chief. The eunuchs who controlled the Armies of Inspired Strategy from the later 700s had themselves awarded a variety of different, impressive, sometimes archaic titles; see under shen-ts’e chün.

In the Three Kingdoms period, Wei had an eminent official entitled pi-shu ling (also Director ...) who managed general administrative affairs and at the same time maintained the imperial archives, but by 227 this post was split into 2, one a chung-shu ling (Secretariat Director) to assist in administration, the other a pi-shu chien to maintain the archives under supervision of the Chamberlain for the Palace Revenues (shao-fu). The first Chin ruler, Wu-ti (r. 265-290), gave control of the archives to the developing Secretariat, but his successor, Hui-ti (r. 290-306), appointed a pi-shu chien to oversee archival materials in 3 Halls (ko) in the outer palace grounds; it was traditionally considered that this marked the beginning of a governmental rather than a personal imperial institution. The Director soon was in charge of a substantial agency called Court of the Palace Library (pi-shu ssu), normally having a Vice Director (ch’eng: aide) and 4 specially esteemed Assistants (lang or lang-chung), each in charge of a Hall (ko) or Bureau (pu) with a subordinate staff of Clerks (ling-shih) and Proofreaders (cheng-shu). Although from time to time both the names and the functions of the Palace Library and the Secretariat seem to have been interchangeable, the Palace Library was increasingly devoted to archival-editorial work. Under the S. Dynasty Sung, which in 464-465 changed the agency’s name to pi-shu sheng (Department of ...) and apparently turned it again into a personal imperial institution, the staff began regularly producing bibliographies called ssu pu mu-lu (Catalogs of the Four Bureaus) and inaugurated the enduring bibliographic division of Chinese books into the categories commonly called the Four Classifications or Four Treasuries (ssu pu). By the end of the S. Dynasties in the 580s the Palace Library was regularly considered one of the major, top-echelon agencies at the dynastic capital called the Five Departments (wu sheng). Meantime N. Wei had adopted the institution (pi-shu sheng) and had given its Director (chien) the high rank of 2 and a large staff still including 4 Assistants (lang); but the title Director seems to have changed back and forth among the terms pi-shu chien, pi-shu ling, and pi-ko ling. Sui’s Director (chien) was initially rank 3a; but in c. 607 the post was reduced to rank 3b and shortly thereafter was renamed ling. T’ang re-established the title chien and fixed the agency name as pi-shu sheng. Except for the intervals from 662 to 670, when the Palace Library was called Orchid Pavilion (lan-t’ai) and its Director was known as Grand Scribe (t’ai-shih), and from 684 to 712, when the agency name was Unicorn Pavilion (lin-t’ai), the title pi-shu chien prevailed till 1380; then the first Ming Emperor reduced the Palace Library institution to the single post of Librarian (tien-chi) in the Hanlin Academy (han-lin yūan). The Director’s rank was 3b in T’ang, 4a in Sung, 3b in Chin, and 6a in early Ming. In Yüan, executive posts in the Palace Library were held by palace eunuchs with the titles Chief Minister (ch’ing), 4’ rank 3a; Director (t’ai-chien), 2, 3b; Vice Director (shao-chien), 2, 4b; and Assistant Director (ch’eng or chien-ch’eng)’ 2’ 5b. From mid-T’ang on, the Directorship generally declined in importance, at times becoming little more than a sinecure; for the compiling and editing work on which it had flourished was taken over increasingly by a variety of new Institutes and Academies, of which the Hanlin Academy (han-lin yüan) is best known; also see, e.g., chi-hsien yüan, ch’ung-wen yüan, hsüeh-shih yüan.

Before the end of the era of N-S Division the Palace Library was officially considered among the top-echelon agencies of the central government called the Five Departments (wu sheng), as was the separate Secretariat. In Sui and early T’ang, for different purposes than in N. Wei (certainly in T’ang, possibly not in Sui), the Palace Library spawned an Inner Branch (pi-shu nei-sheng). In T’ang, this was housed in and subordinate to the Secretariat in the inner precincts of the palace, whereas the Palace Library proper was located among other general-administration agencies in the outer precincts; and the sole purpose of the Inner Branch was to compile some historical records, upon the completion of which in 636 it was apparently terminated. After mid-T’ang the functions of the Palace Library were gradually taken over by other agencies. As early as 630 the Editorial Service (chu-tso chü), long a constituent unit of the Palace Library, was assigned to the preparation of the official state calendar and became relatively autonomous, while Palace Library members called Historiographers (shih-kuan) were transferred out to constitute a separate Historiography Institute (shih-kuan). Before long the archival functions of the Palace Library were taken over by various Academies and Institutes such as the Academy of Scholarly Worthies (chi-hsien yüan), the Hanlin Academy (han-lin yüan), etc. From the early 700s through the Sung era, consequently, the Palace Library ceased functioning; but eminent members of the central government continued to be given Palace Library sinecure appointments for prestige purposes, including Supervisor (t’i-chü). Liao, Chin, and Yüan restored the old agency name pi-shu chien, Ming revived the pi-shu sheng as a functioning institution but in 1380 reduced it to the single post of Librarian (tien-chi) in the Hanlin Academy. Official variant names of the pi-shu sheng included Orchid Pavilion (lan-t’ai) from 662 to 670 and Unicorn Pavilion (lin-t’ai) from 684 to 712. The head of the agency was regularly entitled Director (chien, pi-shu chien), rank 3b in Sui and T’ang, 4a in Sung, 6b in early Ming. There was normally a Vice Director (shao-chien), 4b in Sui and T’ang, 5b in Sung; an Assistant Director (ch’eng), 5a in Sui, 5b1 in T’ang, 7b in Sung; and 4 Assistants (lang), 5b in Sui, 6b1 in T’ang, 8a in Sung. The Assistants in the Palace Library were responsible (at least nominally) for managing the Halls (ko) or Bureaus (pu) among which the agency’s materials were divided for storage and maintenance.

","(3) SUI-CH’ING: Ministry of War, part of the core administrative complex in the central government called the Six Ministries (liu pu); through Chin subordinate to the Department of State Affairs (shang-shu sheng), then to the Secretariat (chung-shu sheng) in Yüan and early Ming; from 1380 directly responsible to the throne though from the early 1400s coordinated ever more tightly by the developing Grand Secretariat (nei-ko). In T’ang, closely affiliated with the Ministries of Justice (hsing-pu) and of Works (kung), these 3 being known as the West Echelon (hsi-hang) of Ministries in the Department of State Affairs; for prestige purposes also considered to join the Ministry of Personnel (lì-pu) in a Front Echelon (ch’ien-hang) of Ministries. In Yüan, intermittently, combined with other Ministries into a War and Justice Ministry (ping-hsing pu) and even a War, Justice, and Works Ministry (ping-hsing-kung pu), known in the aggregate as the Three Ministries of the Right (yu san-pu). Following in the tradition of such prior agencies or officials as the t’ai-wei, ssu-ma or ta ssu-ma, wu ping or ch’i ping, chia-pu, etc., the Ministry in all eras from Sui on was at least nominally in charge of all personnel management, troop dispositions,strategic planning, installations, weapons, and supplies for the whole regular military establishment (see kuan-ping), and for the operation of a postal relay system for handling government communications. It usually supervised,directly or indirectly, other agencies that served essential military needs, e.g., the Court of the Imperial Stud (t’ai-p’u ssu) and its pasturages, from which the Ministry requisitioned the horses needed by the military. From the mid-700s the Ministry lost its prominence in military matters to Imperial Armies (chin-chün) based at the dynastic capital and to regional Military Commissioners (chieh-tu shih). Then in Sung the Ministry became little more than an administrative support agency for the Bureau of Military Affairs (shu-mi yüan), which directed all military operations; in Ming it generally supervised the major operational agencies, the 5 Chief Military Commissions (tu-tu fu; also see wu fu); in Ch’ing it oversaw the Chinese forces called the Green Standards (lu-ying) but had no control over the Banner (see ch’i, pa ch’i) military establishment. From the 1400s Province-level Grand Coordinators or Provincial Governors (hsün-fu) and multiProvince Supreme Commanders or Governors-general (tsung-tu) were commonly granted concurrent status as executive officials of the Ministry for prestige purposes. From Sui on, the Ministry’s executive echelon consisted of a Minister (shang-shu), rank 3a from T’ang through Yüan, then 2a, in Ch’ing one each Manchu and Chinese; and normally 2 Vice Ministers (shih-lang), 4a through Yüan, then 3a, in Ch’ing one each Manchu and Chinese. In Ming and Ch’ing these executives were served by a General Services Office (ssu-Wu t’ing) headed by an Office Manager (ssu-wu), 9b then 8a. The normal business of the Ministry was carried on through 4 subsidiary Bureaus (ssu, ch’ing-li ssu), each headed by a Director (lang-chung), 5b in T’ang, 6a or 6b in Sung, 5b in Chin and Yüan, 5a in Ming and Ch’ing, seconded by a Vice Director (yüan-wai lang), normally 6b. The T’ang-Sung battery of Bureaus included the Bureau of Military Appointments ping-pu ssu; see #2 above), Bureau of Operations (chih-fang ssu), Bureau of Equipment (chia-pu ssu), and Bureau of Provisions (k’u-pu ssu).

Other teaching Erudites were on the staffs of the Sung dynasty Directorate of Education’s Military School (wu-hsüeh); the Medical School (i-hsüeh) maintained at the capital by the T’ang-Sung Imperial Medical Service (t’ai-i chü) including an Erudite for General Medicine (i po-shih), an Erudite for Acupuncture (chen po-shih), an Erudite for Massage (an-mo po-shih), and an Erudite for Exorcism (chou-chin poshih); various Sui-Ch’ing astrological and astronomical services (see t’ai-shih chu, t’ai-shih chien, ssu-t’ien t’ai, ssu-tien chien, ch’in-t’ien chien) including Erudites of the Water Clock (lou-k’o po-shih); and various institutes and academies such as the Court of Imperial Calligraphy (han-lin yü-shu yüan) maintained by the Sung dynasty Artisans Institute (han-lin yüan). Usage of the title Erudite for teachers in schools outside the dynastic capital (and some auxiliary capitals such as Loyang in T’ang and Nanking in Ming) was a temporary aberration. Erudites served in some Princedoms (wang-kuo) during the first Han reigns,no doubt more ritual than teaching Erudites. N. Wei ordered the appointment of Erudites in schools at Region (chou) and Commandery (chün) levels, and this practice reoccurred in very limited ways at the Prefecture (chou, fu) level in Sui, T’ang, and Liao. Emperor Yang of Sui even ordered that Erudites be appointed in District Schools (hsien-hsüeh). By Ming and Ch’ing times the teaching title was restricted to the Directorate of Education and the Directorate of Astronomy (ch’in-t’ien chien) in the central government. Originally, in Han, teaching Erudites were more fully identified as Erudites of the Five Classics (wu-ching po-shih), a title perpetuated throughout history for Erudites in the National University; and other Erudites, such as the Erudites of the Water Clock mentioned above, were normally identified by specifying prefixes. Erudites of the Five Classics from the beginning were specialists in a single classic each and were sometimes even more specifically designated, e.g., as Erudite of the Five Classics (Specializing in) the Mao (Version of the Classic of) Songs (wu-ching mao-shih po-shih). Erudites of the Five Classics originally shared the relatively high 600-bushel rank of their ritual counterparts on the staff of the Chamberlain for Ceremonials, and occasionally in Han a post as teaching Erudite was filled by an official of the very high 2,000-bushel category. Erudites’ status declined after Han, although Ch’en of the S. Dynasties gave them regular rank at the 1,000-bushel level. From T’ang through Ch’ing they held low ranks from 7b to 9b. The original Han number was 14. As the National University grew from an enrollment of 50 to 1,000 to an astonishing 30,000 (Later Han), the number of Erudites swelled to as many as 70. They probably never approached that number again after Han, even in the multiple schools maintained at the capital especially in T’ang and Sung times. By Ming, when the Directorate of Education in fact constituted a single National University, it had an authorized staff of only 5 Erudites; and Ch’ing reduced that number first to 3 and then to 2. Such Erudites were administratively subordinate throughout history to a Chancellor (chi-chiu), originally a post filled by the Erudites in rotation, but from the era of N-S Division a regular post itself; in Ming the Erudites constituted an Office of Erudites (po-shih t’ing) within the National University. From the era of N-S Division the Erudites were assisted by various categories of Instructors (chu-chiao, hsüeh-cheng, hsüeh-lu).

","(2) T’ANG-MING: Rectifier of Omissions, one of several titles used for officials known generically as Remonstrance Officials (chien-kuan, yen-kuan), whose prescribed function was to remonstrate with rulers about their deviations from honored traditions or from laws and administrative regulations, whether in their public or private lives, in contrast to Censors (yü-shih) and other Surveillance Officials (ch’a-kuan), whose traditionally prescribed function was to keep watch over the officialdom and impeach officials for misconduct. Rectifiers of Omissions were specifically responsible for checking drafts of proclamations and other documents flowing from the throne so as to return for reconsideration any that they considered inappropriate in form or substance, or to propose corrections; this procedure is commonly referred to as exercise of a veto power (see under feng-po), although no Remonstrance Official had any legal authority over his ruler or any legal immunity from punishment at the hands of an irate ruler. The position of Rectifier of Omissions was created in 685; thereafter there was an authorized staff of 12, rank 7b1,divided equally between the Chancellery (men-hsia sheng) and the Secretariat (chung-shu sheng) in the top echelon of the central government, prefixed Left and Right, respectively. In Sung, perhaps as early as 988 and probably not later than c. 1020,the title was changed to ssu-chien (Remonstrator) and the position was transferred from the then combined Secretariat-Chancellery (chung-shu men-hsia sheng) to an autonomous Remonstrance Bureau (chien-yüan). Some sources suggest that the title pu-ch’üeh was re-established in the Chancellery and the Secretariat in 1183, but the circumstances are not clear. In Chin there was a Sung style Remonstrance Bureau with both Rectifiers of Omissions and Remonstrators, numbers and ranks not clear. In 1269 Yüan established Left and Right Rectifiers of Omissions, but only to assist Supervising Secretaries (chi-shih chung) keep records of memorials submitted to the throne and compile the Imperial Diary (ch’i-chü chu); in 1278 the title was changed to the more appropriate Imperial Attendant and Concurrent Compiler of the Imperial Diary (shih-i feng-yü chien hsiu ch’i-chü chu). In Yüan remonstrance functions were explicitly shifted to the Censorate (yü-shih t’ai). In early Ming a Remonstrance Bureau was revived briefly from 1380 to 1382, but without Rectifiers of Omission; this title reappeared once more, however, in the 1399- 1402 era, at least one each Left and Right, on the staff of the Transmission Commissioner (t’ung-cheng shih). But during Ming and Ch’ing, in general, the remonstrance function was carried on by Censors and Supervising Secretaries. Also see chien-i ta-fu, shih-i, cheng-yen, ch’i-chü chu pu-ch’üeh.

E.g., Chief Administrator of the Erudites (po-shih p’u-yeh), Supervisor of an Army Farm (chün-t’un p’u-yeh), 2 Chief Administrators of the Music Office (yüeh-fu p’u-yeh) under a Director (ling), eunuch Chief Administrator of the Palace Discipline Service (yung-hsiang chü) under a Director (ling).

","(2) HAN-SUNG: Vice Director of the Later Han Imperial Secretariat (shang-shu t’ai), thereafter of the Department of State Affairs (shang-shu sheng), in both cases under a Director (ling). During the era of N-S Division, the appointment of Left and Right Vice Directors became the normal practice. Rank 2b in T’ang, 1b in Sung. The post was initiated in 32 B.C. The next most important date in its history is A.D. 626, when the Imperial Prince Li Shih-min, who had been serving in his father’s government as Director of the Department of State Affairs, took the T’ang throne, to become the renowned ruler known posthumously as T’ang T’ai-tsung. In deference to him, no one accepted the directorship during his reign, and thereafter through Sung times the Director was an inactive post and the Vice Directors were in fact joint heads of the Department. As such, they joined the Director of the Secretariat (chung-shu ling) and the Director of the Chancellery (men-hsia shih-chung) as senior Grand Councilors (tsai-hsiang), at least in theory attending daily conferences with the Emperor to make decisions about state policies. In recognition of their importance, the Vice Directors were officially retitled Rectifiers of Governance (k’uang-cheng) from 662 to 671; from 684 to 705 Ministers (hsiang) of the Pavilion of Culture and Prosperity (wen-ch’ang t’ai, wen-ch’ang tu-sheng), from 713 to 741 Counselors-in-chief (ch’eng-hsiang); and they were commonly known by the supplementary title Manager of Affairs (p’ing-chang shih). In Sung the Vice Director of the Left was commonly Concurrent Vice Director of the Chancellery (chien men-hsia shih-lang), and the Vice Director of the Right was commonly Concurrent Vice Director of the Secretariat (chien chung-shu shih-lang); and the pair were normally de facto heads of the government under the Emperor. From the time of Hui-tsung (r. 1100-1125) the Vice Directors of the Left and Right bore the awesome archaic titles t’ai-tsai (Senior Grand Councilor) and shao-tsai (Junior Grand Councilor), respectively, and they were known by such cumbersome full designations as Senior Grand Councilor Vice Director of the Department of State Affairs Jointly Manager of Affairs with the Secretariat-Chancellery (t’ai-tsai shang-shu p’u-yeh t’ung chung-shu men-hsia p’ing-chang shih). In the era 1162-1189 the title Counselor-in-chief (ch’eng-hsiang) was again revived. Throughout its history the title p’u-yeh was commonly rendered shang-shu p’u-yeh. After Sung it dropped from use.

From the early 500s if not earlier, it began to be used also in the sense of inactive prefixed to official titles and even such titles of nobility as Duke (kung) when they were awarded to men without official status or prescribed duties, or when added to a man’s official title for honorific purposes only, in neither case providing a stipend or increasing one’s established stipend. At the same time san began to be appended to the titles of officials when they were not in active service - between appointments, when disabled or overaged, etc.—apparently in an effort to give some social status (and stipends?) to sometime officials in such conditions. In Sui this practice was transformed into grants of Prestige Titles (san-kuan, q.v.) for officials in active service, to pinpoint their ranks and seniority within any rank, which regular titles (kuan, pen-kuan) did not do. The term san was not itself incorporated into such prestige titles, but it occasionally reappeared in the other usages described above, often seeming to denote irregular, supernumerary, but not merely honorific status, as in the case of several Sung dynasty titles, e.g., san chih-hui.

Into the Sung period prestige titles continued to be used as indicators of rank status, regardless of either the nominal office (pen-kuan) or the duty assignment (ch’ai-ch’ien), from late T’ang allowing great disparities among ranks,nominal posts, and actual functions. Reforms of 1080 greatly reduced the extravagant use of prestige titles by redesignating them rank offices (chieh-kuan) and, apparently for the first time, making them rather than nominal offices the basis on which official salaries were paid. In 1120 this change was made more emphatic with the adoption of a new set of titles under the generic designation salary offices (chi-lu kuan). From Chin through Ch’ing the early san-kuan practices were stabilized; salaries were again determined by nominal offices, nominal offices increasingly reflected actual functions, and the terms san-kuan, chieh-kuan, and the combination san-chieh were all used synonymously for standardized prestige titles that most specifically denoted rank and seniority within ranks. From the outset, prestige titles were generally variably-prefixed Grand Masters (ta-fu) from ranks 1 through 5 and variably-prefixed Gentlemen (lang) from ranks 6 through 9 in the civil service, and their counterparts in the military service were normally Generals (chiang-chün) and Commandants (hsiao-wei). There were enough prestige titles so that an official could be promoted in the hierarchy of prestige titles without a change of actual rank (p’in) or nominal office. In Ming and Ch’ing an official was entitled to an appropriate prestige title after completing his initial 3-year term of active duty, and he could request that the same title be conferred (posthumously if need be) on his father and grandfather. In formal documentation prestige titles took precedence over nominal offices; e.g.’ a Ming official might be designated Grand Master for Excellent Counsel (chia-i ta-fu, the first or lowest of 3 prestige titles awarded to officials of rank 3a), Vice Minister of War and Concurrent Vice Censor-in-chief (ping-pu shih-lang chien fu tu yü-shih, both nominal offices of rank 3 a); and so cumbersome a designation might in addition be preceded or followed by reference to a detached duty assignment such as Grand Coordinator of Kiangsi Province (hsün-fu chiang-hsi).","RR: titre qui ne comporte pas de fonction.","SP: titre de prestige ou fonctionnaire ne comportant pas de fonction.

Wei to Yüan commonly superseded or overshadowed by the term Three Preceptors (san shih, q.v.). The posts were seldom conferred capriciously and were considered regular substantive posts throughout history; until Sui each was provided with subordinate officials constituting an Office (fu). However, from mid-Han on appointees as such had no functional responsibilities except to attend audiences and provide counsel to rulers when called on. Nevertheless, appointees were almost always officials with additional functional appointments that gave them effective supervisory authority over the central government, e.g., as Grand Councilors (tsai-hsiang) or Grand Secretaries (ta hsüeh-shih). From Chou on, the individual titles of the Three Dukes were ordinarily Grand Preceptor (t’ai-shih), Grand Mentor (t’ai-fu), and Grand Guardian (t’ai-pao). Notable exceptions included the Ch’in-Former Han era, when the Three Dukes consisted of the Counselor-in-chief (ch’eng-hsiang), the Censor-in-chief (yü-shih ta-fu), and the Defender-in-chief (t’ai-wei) and their variants. In Later Han the old-style Three Dukes were restored with the collective designation Superior Dukes (shang-kung). After Han, in Chin and the S. Dynasties, Grand Preceptor was commonly replaced with Grand Steward (ta-tsai). From Sui till 1122 in Sung and Liao, while the designation Three Preceptors prevailed, the term Three Dukes also continued in use, referring to the Defender-in-chief (t’ai-wei), the Minister of Education (ssu-t’u), and the Minister of Works (ssu-k’ung), of equal rank but slightly less prestige than the Three Preceptors. In Chou the Three Dukes ranked as Feudal Lords (chu-hou); in Han their rank swelled to 10,000 bushels; from the era of N-S Division they normally ranked 1a. A group of related titles of slightly less prestige was the Three Solitaries (san ku), e.g., Junior Preceptor (shao-shih), likewise derived from ancient Chou usage and revived in Sung; and complete sets of Three Dukes and Three Solitaries were also commonly assigned to the Heir Apparent and prefixed accordingly, e.g., as Grand Preceptor of the Heir Apparent (t’ai-tzu t’ai-shih).","HB: three excellencies.

Not later than the time of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141—87 B.C.), normally 4 appointees,each in charge of a functionally differentiated Section (ts’ao; see under ssu ts’ao); functionally if not nominally, had become a more important category of officials, now appropriately rendered Imperial Secretaries (see under #2 following).

Appointees were required to pass a vocabulary test involving 9,000 characters and came to be assisted in each Section by an Aide (ch’eng) and a Secretarial Court Gentleman (shang-shu lang). Late in Emperor Wu’s reign the Imperial Secretaries were overshadowed if not superseded by palace eunuchs appointed as Palace Secretaries (chung-shu), the great historian Ssu-ma Ch’ien being perhaps the first such appointee after his castration; but in 29 B.C. the Palace Secretaries were withdrawn from formal administrative duties and probably abolished, whereupon the Imperial Secretaries resumed their earlier functions and were increased to 5 (see under wu ts’ao). In Later Han the number was further increased to 6 (see under liu ts’ao). From Former Han times the group was known unofficially by the collective designation Imperial Secretariat (shang-shu t’ai), which in its full Later Han maturity had an executive superstructure consisting of a Director (ling), rank 1,000 bushels, a Vice Director (p’u-yeh), 600 bushels, and one each Left and Right Aide (tso-ch’eng, yu-ch’eng), 400 bushels. This pattern of organization was perpetuated in the following era of N-S Division, gradually becoming a stable top-level organ commonly called shang-shu sheng (lit., Department of Imperial Secretaries, but normally rendered Department of State Affairs); and the Imperial Secretaries were gradually transformed into formally recognized executives of the central government (see #3 following).

Throughout the era of N-S Division the units headed by Ministers were called either Sections (ts’ao) or Ministries (pu); the term Ministry predominated late in the era and was the standard from Sui through Ch’ing. Their number fluctuated greatly at first; a cluster of 12 was common, and at times the number grew to more than 30; but from Sui through Ch’ing 6 was the standard (see under liu pu): Ministries of Personnel (lì-pu),of Revenue (hu-pu), of Rites (lǐ-pu), of War (ping-pu), of Justice (hsing-pu), and of Works (kung-pu).

There was normally only one Minister for each Ministry through Sung and Chin; YÜAN appointed 3 in each Ministry; Ming reverted to a single appointee; Ch’ing commonly appointed one Manchu and one Chinese. In the mature organization of Ministries, the Minister was assisted by one or more Vice Ministers (shih-lang) and supervised 4 or more subordinate Bureaus (ssu; ch’ing-li ssu in Ming and Ch’ing) with function-specific or, in some Ming-Ch’ing Ministries, region-specific responsibilities.

In 636 units previously called the Twelve Guards (shih-erh wei) were reorganized into the Sixteen Guards; at least in theory they were the principal defense force for the dynastic capital city, the palace, and the Emperor, in the aggregate called the Southern Command (nan-ya) in contrast to the Northern Command (pei-ya) of Armies (chün) that was the main striking force of the early T’ang rulers. The Guards consisted principally of militiamen called up from their local Garrisons (see fu) in rotational patterns, each Guard having an assigned geographic grouping of Garrisons under its jurisdiction, at least for the management of such troop rotations (see under/an, Term of Service; cf. pan-chün). Each Guard was commanded by a General-in-chief (ta chiang-chün), rank 3a1, and 2 Generals (chiang-chün), 3a2. From 786 an even more prestigious Generalissimo (shang chiang-chün), 2a2, was normally the Guard leader. Each Guard had administrative and logistical support agencies largely headed by civil service officials: an Administrative Aide (chang-shih), 6b1; an Administrative Supervisor (lu-shih ts’an-chun-shih), 8a1; an Administrator for Granaries (ssu-ts’ang ts’an-chün-shih), 8a2; an Administrator for Arms (ssu-ping ts’an-chün-shih), 8a2; an Administrator for Cavalry (chi-ping ts’an-chün-shih), 8a2; etc. In the early 700s these support services were reorganized into Sections (ts’ao): the Administrator for Granaries was replaced by 2 Administrators of a Granaries Section (ts’ang-ts’ao ts’an-chün-shih), the Administrator for Arms by 2 Administrators of an Arms Section (ping-ts’ao), the Administrator for Cavalry by 2 Administrators of a Cavalry Section (chi-ts’ao); and by 705 there was added an Armor Section (k’ai-ts’ao), in c. 712 renamed Helmets Section (chou-ts’ao), with 2 Administrators. Meantime, the Garrison Militia system (fu-ping) and its troop rotations deteriorated significantly, so that by 749 the Guards ceased calling up militiamen. Thereafter into Sung the Sixteen Guards were decorative, militarily unimportant units existing almost solely to provide grandiose titles and appropriate perquisites for members of the imperial family and occasionally other favored dignitaries; and active defense of the Emperor and his palace was managed with other forces such as the late T’ang Permanent Palace Guard (ch’ang-ts’ung su-wei, k’uo-chi) and the Sung Palace Command (tien-ch’ien shih-wei ssu), counterpart of the early T’ang Southern Command. In Sung the general officers of the Sixteen Guards ranked 2b, 3a, or 3b (Generalissimos), 3a or 4a (Generals-in-chief). and 3b or 4b (Generals); and such titles became prestige titles (san-kuan) conferred automatically on military officers according to the ranks of their substantive posts. In both T’ang and Sung, names of the individual Guards changed from time to time, but the most common names in T’ang were the Left and Right Guards (tso-wei, yu-wei), 2 Courageous Guards (hsiao-wei) prefixed Left and Right as in all following cases, 2 Militant Guards (wu-wei), 2 Awesome Guards (wei-wei), 2 Metropolitan Guards (ling-chün wei), 2 Imperial Insignia Guards (chin-wu wei), 2 Palace Gate Guards (chien-men wei), and 2 Personal Guards (ch’ien-niu wei). The Sung array similarly included the Left and Right Guards, the Courageous Guards, the Militant Guards, the Imperial Insignia Guards, the Palace Gate Guards, and the Personal Guards, and in addition 2 Encampment Guards (t’un-wei) and 2 Army Guards (chun-wei). In both T’ang and Sung times the Sixteen Guards were commonly referred to as the Imperial Guards (huan-wei), and some of their names, prefixed t’ai-tzu, appeared in the establishment of the Heir Apparent.

In the case of Kaifeng 2 Capital Townships, one Left and one Right, supervised the area within the city walls as Inner Capital Townships (nei-hsiang), and 2 others, also differentiated as Left and Right, supervised the area immediately surrounding the walled city as Outer Capital Townships (wai-hsiang). The extramural population grew so rapidly tiiat 8 additional Outer Townships were established in 1008 (or the existing 2 were increased to a total of 8?); and a 9th was added in 1021. In the case of Hangchow, where Four Capital Townships were established in the 1130s, there were similarly 2 Inner Townships differentiated as Left and Right, but the 2 Outer Townships were differentiated as South and North. In both capitals, all Capital Townships were supervised or directed by Censors (yü-shih) on rotational duty assignments as Capital Inspectors (hsün-shih), and the central government’s Bureau of Military Affairs (shu-mi yüan) occasionally delegated senior officers as Military Directors-in-chief (ping-ma tu-chien) to oversee the military aspects of Township operations. The regular Township establishment was dominated by a Police Office (chün-hsün yüan) staffed by junior military officers serving as Military Inspectors (chün-hsün shih) and Administrative Assistants (chün-hsün p’an-kuan); there were also civil officials serving as Police Executives (kung-shih kan-tang kuan) or Managers (kou-kuan).

P35.","(2) 5 DYN-MING: Directorate of Astronomy, an autonomous agency in the central government concerned with making and recording astronomical observations, preparing the official calendar issued annually by the state, and training students of astronomy; branched off from, and through Yüan partly coexisted with, a tradition of astrologically-oriented institutions stemming from the Grand Astrologer (t’ai-shih, t’ai-shih ling) of high antiquity. This name apparently originated in the Later Chou state (950-959) as a replacement for the T’ang Bureau of Astronomy (ssu-t’ien t’ai),which was headed by a Director (chien); in Later Chou the agency was headed by a Chief Minister of the Court of the Imperial Treasury (t’ai-fu ssu ch’ing) as concurrent Supervisor (p’an). Sung perpetuated the Later Chou institution and added a separate Bureau of Astronomy (t’ien-wen yüan) in the 1060s (?), but after 1078 both seem to have fallen under the dominance of a more traditional Astrological Service (t’ai-shih chü), which unlike the astronomical agencies indulged in weather forecasting and various astrological esoterica; all 3 agencies were in some degree subordinated to the Palace Library (pi-shu sheng). Consolidation of these different agencies was achieved by Liao in a ssu-t’ien chien headed by a t’ai-shih ling, for which Chin revived the T’ang name ssu-t’ien t’ai. In Yüan an original Bureau of Astronomy (ssu-t’ien t’ai) was renamed ssu-t’ien chien in the 1260s, and after 1271 there was at least one Branch Directorate of Astronomy (hsing ssu-t’ien chien), location not clear; the Directorate was headed by a Superintendent (t’i-tien) whose rank changed from 4a to 3a in 1314 and then back to 4a in 1320; he was aided by 3 Directors (chien), also rank 4a, and 5 Vice Directors (shao-chien), rank 5a. However, in 1267 the Directorate was effectively subordinated to a higher-ranking Astrological Commission (t’ai-shih yüan), which thereafter was principally responsible for preparation of the calendar while the Directorate became primarily an institution for the training of astronomers for service in the Commission. The Directorate’s executive posts became almost sinecures, and its principal active officials were 2 Superintendents of Training (t’i-hsüeh), rank 9b, and 2 Instructors (chiao-shou) of equal rank, who oversaw subdivisions called the Section for Astronomy (t’ien-wen k’o), the Section for Calendrícal Calculations (suan-li k’o), the Section for Astrological Interpretation (san-shih k’o), the Section for Validations (ts’e-yen k’o), and the Water Clock Section (lou-k’o k’ó), each administered by 2 Clerks (kuan-kou) of 9b rank. In early Ming, from 1368 to 1370, a ssut’ien chien existed under the leadership of a Director (ling), rank 3a; but it was then permanently renamed ch’in-t’ien chien (Directorate of Astronomy), Also see hui-hui ssu-t’ien chien.","SP: direction des observations astronomiques.

P26.","(3) MING-CH’ING: Grand Secretary, officials of great power in the central government, comparable to Grand Councilors (tsai-hsiang) of earlier dynasties; originated in 1382 as a new category of posts in the Hanlin Academy (han-lin yüan), rank 5a, with the specific duties of tutoring the Heir Apparent and assisting the Emperor with his paperwork, which had greatly increased after reorganizations of 1380 that included abolition of the Grand Councilorship. In the early 1400s their influence increased, and from 1424 they were regularly given concurrent nominal appointments as Vice Ministers (shih-lang) or Ministers (shang-shu) in the Six Ministries (liu pu), which raised their ranks to the level of 3a or 2a; in addition, they came to be given even more prestigious status in the officialdom with top-echelon but non-functioning posts among the Three Dukes (san kung) or Three Solitaries (san ku), with 1a or 1b rank. Each Grand Secretary was assigned to a Hall in the palace, e.g., Grand Secretary of the Hall of Military Glory (wu-ying tien ta hsüeh-shih); their numbers varied, normally in the range from 3 to 6, and their working procedures gradually stabilized under a Senior Grand Secretary (shou-fu) as recognized leader and decision-maker in the group. Their principal function came to be recommending imperial action on memorials and preparing edicts after an imperial decision was reached; they utilized the services of the Central Drafting Office (chung-shu k’o) but had no supporting staffs of their own. After the earliest years, appointees as Grand Secretaries came almost exclusively through a special channel from status as Metropolitan Graduates (chin-shih) in the civil service recruitment examination sequence into a series of positions in the Hanlin Academy, without ever having active service in regular administrative agencies, either in central or territorial administrations. Consequently, despite their nominal status as Ministers or Vice Ministers, which was intended to provide a linkage for them with the administrative hierarchy, Grand Secretaries inevitably came to be looked on as members of the Inner Court (nei-t’ing, nei-ch’ao) who were agents of the Emperor, not as leaders of the Outer Court (wai-t'ing, wai-ch’ao) comparable to Counselors-in-chief (ch’eng-hsiang) of antiquity; and from early in the 16th century they became focal points of controversies between the Inner and Outer Courts. Few Senior Grand Secretaries had successful, happy tenures. From the beginning the Grand Secretaries were referred to collectively as ihe nei-ko (lit., the inner or palace Halls), and by 1600 this term became at least a quasiofficial agency name, rendered as Grand Secretariat. In Ch’ing, after some institutional experimenting (see under nei san yüan, Three Palace Academies), the Grand Secretariat was formally constituted in 1658 as the paramount coordinating agency in the central government with a large staff headed by 2 Manchu and 2 Chinese Grand Secretaries, rank 1a, each nominally assigned to a palace Hall as in Ming times. Although the Grand Secretariat as an institution gradually yielded in influence to informal deliberative groups and eventually was formally subordinated to a Council of State (chün-chi ch’u) in 1730, individual Grand Secretaries remained prestigious and commonly served ex officio as members of the Council of State.

","(1) HAN-SUNG: created in 124 B.C., when 50 disciples or students were chosen and distributed among 5 pre-existing Erudites (po-shih) on the staff of the Chamberlain for Ceremonials (t’ai-ch’ang); thereafter was the paramount educational institution in dynastic capitals, staffed most importantly by Erudites supervised by a Chief Administrator (p’u-yeh) or, from late in Former Han, a Chancellor (chi-chiu). In Han the number of Erudites and students fluctuated considerably, enrollment rising to 3,000 under Wang Mang’s patronage and to 30,000 in the 2nd century A.D. Post-Han dynasties perpetuated the University in coexistence with other educational agencies. The names t’ai-hsüeh and kuo-hsüeh (lit., school of the state) alternated and sometimes apparently coexisted, and in addition there was commonly a School for the Sons of the State (kuo-tzu hsüeh). In Sui the National University became one of 3 major schools now removed from traditional status in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices (t’ai-ch’ang ssu) and organized into a consolidated Directorate of Education (kuo-tzu chien) headed by a Chancellor with the assistance of a Director of Studies (ssu-yeh); the t’ai-hsüeh alone had some 500 students regularly enrolled. In T’ang the new Directorate of Education was expanded to incorporate 7 schools; the t’ai-hsüeh continued to enroll some 500 students under Erudites, its students being primarily the sons of lesser nobles and middle-rank officials. In early Sung the 2 principal schools in the Directorate were consolidated into a single institution, t’ai-hsüeh and kuo-tzu hsüeh both becoming variant references to the Directorate; some 4,000 students were divided among 80 Study Halls (chai). In reforms of the 1070s the school was reorganized into 3 Colleges (she): an Outer College (wai-she), about 20% of whose graduates continued their studies in an Inner College (nei-she), less than half of whose graduates were admitted to a Superior College (shang-she). In S. Sung the whole Directorate of Education declined in vitality, in part because of a burgeoning of private Academies (shu-yüan), but it retained a regular enrollment of some 1,000 students. Throughout its history, the National University served as a channel through which educated men were obtained for service as officials. Some of its graduates always moved directly into low-level official posts; others were good prospects for service as subalterns of regional and local authorities, from whom some could get recommendations that moved them up into regular office. From Sui on, graduates commonly competed in both regular and irregular civil service recruitment examinations with candidates qualified by other means such as recommendation. The rise in importance of relatively open recruitment examinations probably was most responsible for the decline of the National University in S. Sung.

In 733 Circuits were increased to 15, each with an Investigation Commissioner (ts’ai-fang shih), soon retitled Surveillance Commissioner (kuan-ch’a shih); the Commissioners became more stable coordinators of territorial administration. In response to the great rebellion of An Lu-shan beginning in 755, many Surveillance Commissioners were made concurrent Military-Commissioners (chieh-tu shih); soon Circuits had both Surveillance and Military Commissioners as civil and military supervisors, respectively. As regional warlordism escalated, Military Commissioners of this type and those described under (2) above commonly became almost autonomous regional satraps, and their number grew large. At the end of T’ang, Circuits in South China were transformed into the independent regimes known to historians as the Ten Kingdoms, and Military Commissioners succeeded one another in control of the North China Plain, establishing the Five Dynasties that followed T’ang. When most of China Proper was reconsolidated by Sung, it was again divided into 10 Circuits, but governmental powers in each Circuit were divided among several function-specific Commissioners; see under ssu chien-ssu (Four Circuit Supervisorates). In 997 such Circuits were all redesignated lu, q.v.","RR: province.

Except for the Circuit surrounding the Supreme Capital, which was governed by the dynastic central government, each Circuit was governed by a Regent (liu-shou) with a staff including 2 Grand Councilors (tsai-hsiang).","(5) YÜAN: the jurisdiction of a Pacification Commission (hsüan-wei ssu), as many as 60 into which the empire was  divided for administrative, military, or combined military and administrative supervision; each supervised a cluster of Route Commands (lu tsung-kuan fu) and in turn was responsible to the metropolitan Secretariat (chung-shu sheng) at Peking or to a Branch Secretariat (hsing chung-shu sheng) and, for military purposes, to the metropolitan Bureau of Military Affairs (shu-mi yüan) or one of its branches. In lieu of Pacification Commissions, some Circuits had comparable agencies named Pacification Commission and Chief Military Command (hsüan-wei ssu tu yüan-shuai fu), Chief Military Command (tu yüan-shuai fu), Military Command (yüan-shuai fu), or a further variant such as hsüan-fu ssu, an-fu ssu, or chao-t’ao ssu (all rendered Pacification Commission). ","(6) YÜAN: also the separate jurisdiction of a Surveillance Commission (t’i-hsing an-ch’a ssu, su-cheng lien-fang ssu), 24 at their peak, each a regional subordinate of the metropolitan Censorate (yü-shih t’ai) or one of its branches.","(7) MING-CH’ING: the jurisdiction of a Branch Office (fen-ssu) of a Provincial Administration Commission (ch’eng-hsüan pu-cheng shih ssu) or a Provincial Surveillance Commission (t’i-hsing an-ch’a shih ssu), staffed by a Vice Commissioner (ts’an-cheng, an-ch’a fu-shih) or an Assistant Commissioner (ts’an-i, an-ch’a ch’ien-shih) of such a provincial agency. Officials on such duty were known generically as Circuit Intendants (tao-t’ai). Some Circuits were function-specific and had Province-wide responsibilities, such as Tax Intendant Circuits ","(tu-liang tao), Education Intendant Circuits (t’i-tu hsüeh-tao), Troop Purification Circuits (ch’ing-chün tao), and Postal Service Circuits (i-ch’uan tao). Others exercised full powers of their base agencies in limited areas; these were called General Administration Circuits (fen-shou tao) and General Surveillance Circuits (fen-hsün tao). Circuit Intendants delegated from Provincial Surveillance Commissions also in-cluded several who were limited both in area and in function: Record Checking Circuits (shua-chüan tao) and Military Defense Circuits (ping-pei tao). This pattern persisted until 1735, when Circuits were given status as regular posts (kuan) rather than duty assignments (ch’ai-ch’ien); were dissociated, at least nominally, from the provincial agencies; and got more direct authority over the Prefectures in their jurisdictions. Most continued to be General Administration Circuits (shou-tao) or General Surveillance Circuits (hsün-tao), but function-specific Circuits also survived, especially Waterways Circuits (ho-tao), Grain Tax Circuits (tu-liang tao), Military Defense Circuits (ping-pei tao), River Maintenance Circuits (ho-wu tao), Irrigation Circuits (shui-li tao), Education Circuits (hsüeh-cheng tao), etc. In the middle 1700s the total number of all Circuits in the empire was 89. After the reorganization of 1735, the name of a Circuit and the title of its Intendant were generally identical, and the rank of all Intendants was 4a.","BH: circuit.","(8) MING-CH’ING: also subsections, one named for each Province (sheng), among which Investigating Censors (chien-ch’a yü-shih) were distributed for internal administrative purposes within the Censorate (tu ch’a-kuan), each headed by one member designated Investigating Censor in charge of the ...

On one hand, the individual authority and responsibility of each Censor, or his independence from the Censors-in-chief (tu yü-shih) and other executive officials of the Censorate, were emphasized by the official designation of Censors as members of their Circuits, never as members of the Censorate. On the other hand, although members of the Circuits were routinely responsible for auditing accounts and reviewing judicial proceedings emanating from the Provinces for which the Gircuits were named, they were based in the dynastic capital, and when Censors were sent out from the capital on special investigatory assignments they were sent to Provinces without regard to the names of the Circuits of which they were members. In addition to its routine functions, each Circuit was assigned responsibility for maintaining disciplinary surveillance over a specified group of central government agencies, including the Censorate itself. In Ming all Investigating Censors on duty in the capital at any time were considered to constitute a Metropolitan Circuit (ching-chi tao), with responsibility for checking records in the capital agencies. In Ch’ing the Metropolitan Circuit became a Circuit like any other, with routine responsibilities regarding the Metropolitan Area (chih-li); and routine surveillance over the administration of Manchuria, which was eventually divided into 3 Provinces, was vested in a single Liao-Shen Circuit, i.e., Circuit for Liaoyang and Shen-yang.","BH: circuit.

Created in 1367 alongside Branch Secretariats (hsing chung-shu sheng) to administer provincial areas captured from the disintegrating Yüan state, then from 1376 shared provincial authority with Provincial Administration Commissions (ch’eng-hsüan pu-cheng shih ssu) and Regional Military Commissions (tu chih-hui shih ssu). Abolished in 1380 but revived in 1381. During the 1400s the triad of provincial agencies came to be coordinated by central government dignitaries delegated as Grand Coordinators (hsün-fu) of Provinces and furtner by multi-Province Supreme Commanders (tsung-tu). As Grand Coordinators and Supreme Commanders became more stably entrenched in late Ming, and especially when they were transformed into regular posts as Governors and Governors-general, respectively, in Ch’ing times, the Surveillance Commissions became in effect provincial-level staff agencies for judicial and penal administration, and their role in censorial surveillance declined without disappearing. The Commissions were collectively called the Outer Censorate (wai-t’ai), and their personnel shared with Censors (yü-shih) such traditional collective designations as Surveillance Officials (ch’a-kuan) and Guardians of the Customs and Fundamental Laws (feng-hsien kuan); moreover, the Censorate (yü-shih t’ai till 1380, then tu ch’a-yüan) was the central government channel for all communications between the Commissions and the throne. Nevertheless, the Commissions were not branch Censorates, nor were they directly controlled by the Censorate. [In Ming times the Censorate had its own representatives in the Provinces, principally Investigating Censors (chien-ch’a yü-shih) serving as Regional Inspectors (hsün-an yü-shih), who participated importantly in all decision-making assemblages of provincial officials.] Each Surveillance Commission was headed by a Surveillance Commissioner (an-ch’a shih), rank 3a, with a support staff including a Registry (ching-li ssu), a Records Office (chao-mo so), and a Prison (ssu-yü ssu). There were variable numbers of Surveillance Vice Commissioners (an-ch’a fu-shih), 4a, and Assistant Surveillance Commissioners (an-ch’a ch’ien-shih), 5a; they were assigned to Branch Offices (fen-ssu), each with a jurisdiction called a Circuit (tao), and were generically called Circuit Intendants (tao-t’ai), a designation they shared with counterparts in Branch Offices of Provincial Administration Commissions. In each Ming Province there were from 3 to 9 General Surveillance Circuits (fen-hsün tao), from 2 to 7 Record Checking Circuits (shua-chüan tao), and from one to 12 Military Defense Circuits (ping-pei tao), all with specified geographic jurisdictions encompassing several Prefectures (fu). Each Province also had function-specific Circuits: one Troop Purification Circuit (ch’ing-chün tao), one Postal Service Circuit (i-chuan tao), and one Education Intendant Circuit (t’i-tu hsüeh tao). As local circumstances warranted, there were also such function-specific Circuits as Irrigation Circuits (shui-li tao), State Farms Circuits (t’un-t’ien tao), Waterways Circuits (kuan-ho tao), and Salt Control Circuits (yen-fa tao) with limited territorial jurisdictions. This Ming pattern was perpetuated with minor changes into mid-Ch’ing times. Then in 1735 Circuit Intendants were all made regular posts (kuan) in their own right with 4a rank, dissociated at least nominally from the Surveillance Commissions, becoming formal intermediaries between Provinces and Prefectures rather than representatives of the Surveillance Commissions.

Such field commanders dispatched from the Palace Command were commonly known also as Marshals (yüan-shuai), Grand Marshals (ta yüan-shuai), or, more formally, Pacification Commissioners (hsüan-fu shih). The headquarters of the Palace Command seems to have been staffed principally by Administrative Aides (ya-pan), probably palace eunuchs of the 4th and 5th ranks. The Palace Command was under the joint supervisory jurisdiction of the Bureau of Military Affairs (shu-mi yüan) and the Ministry of War (ping-pu), and from c. 1084 the Ministry of Personnel (lì-pu) administered the appointments of military officers as well as civil officials (see under hsüan, yu-hsüan). The Palace Command existed through S. Sung, but it declined in importance as the original Imperial Armies gradually lost their primary role in Sung military organization and became little more than labor gangs at the disposal of the central government or those who dominated it, while the burden of active military defense against the Jurchen and then the Mongols was borne principally by regionally-based forces (see under yü-ch’ien chün).","SP: bureau devant le palais."]},"6543":{"id":"6543","page":"p438","pingYin":"","term":"殿前司","explanation":["SUNG: abbreviation of tien-ch’ien shih-wei ssu (Palace Command)."]},"6544":{"id":"6544","page":"p438","pingYin":"tièn-chién tū tiěn-chiěn ssū ","term":"殿前都點檢司","explanation":["CHIN: Palace Inspectorate-general, the chief central government agency in charge of military protection of the palace and the capital city, staffed with Jurchen noblemen; comparable to the Sung dynasty Palace Command (tien-ch’ien shih-wei ssu)."]},"6545":{"id":"6545","page":"p438","pingYin":"tiěn-chìh ","term":"典彘","explanation":["N-S DIV (Chou): Manager of Swine, ranked as an Ordinary Serviceman (chung-shih), a member of the Ministry of Works (tung-kuan) apparently responsible for the provisioning of pigs for eating in the palace and the central government.

In Sung these ranks slipped, e.g., to 4b for the Director, and the agency was often overseen by a Supervisor (p’an sheng-shih). The Palace Administration included 6 subsidiary Services (chü), each headed by 2 Chief Stewards (feng-yü), 5a, and several Foremen (chih-chang), 7a, in T’ang; in Sung the whole battery was controlled by a Supervisor of the Six Services (t’i-chü liu shang-chü) and a Manager (kou-tang kuan). The Six Services (liu chü, liu shang-chü, liu shang) were the Food Service (shang-shih chü), Medicines Service (shang-yao chü), Clothing Service (shang-i chü), Accommodations Service (shang-she chü), Sedan-chair Service (shang-lien chü), and Livery Service (shang-ch’eng chü); in Sung the last of these was replaced by a Wines Service (shang-yün chü). Until 735 the Palace Administration also managed an Imperial Treasury (t’ien-fu tsang). In Sung various other agencies were assigned to the Administration for supervision: a Minor Gifts Storehouse (ch’in-i k’u) managed jointly by official and eunuch Supervisors (chien-kuan); an Imperial Wardrobe (shang-i k’u) managed jointly by a Commissioner (shih) and 2 eunuch Supervisors; from 976 a Special Gifts Storehouse (nei i-wu k’u) managed jointly by official and eunuch Supervisors; from 1103 an Imperial Dispensary (yü-yao yüan) managed by a eunuch Manager (kou-tang kuan) and a Storehouse of Court Ritual Regalia (ch’ao-fu fa-wu k’u) managed jointly by official and eunuch Supervisors. Nevertheless, in Sung the executive posts in the Palace Administration were normally sinecures for imperial in-laws and other palace favorites, and active supervision of palace administration became increasingly the responsibility of the Court of Palace Attendants (hsüan-hui yüan, q.v.).

Originating in 1452 with the delegation of a Censor-in-chief (tu yü-shih) to supervise military operations in Kwangtung and Kwangsi, became steadily more common during the later 1400s and in the 1500s was standard throughout most of the country, the Supreme Commander becoming a long-term resident supervisor of Grand Coordinators (hsün-fu) in regional clusters of 2 or more Provinces. In the normal case, the Supreme Commander was himself Grand Coordinator of one of the Provinces under his supervision, which numbered as many as 5. Although he established a headquarters (see k’ai-fu), he was not authorized any official assistants; to the end of the dynasty, no matter how influential and powerful he was in fact, his status in the governmental hierarchy remained that of an ad hoc trouble-shooter with responsibilities and powers specified in each case.

In the mature Ch’ing system there were 9 such posts: one each for Chihli and Szechwan, combining Governorships; one for the 3 Manchurian Provinces of Fengtien, Kirin, and Heilungkiang combining the Governorship of Fengtien; one for Fukien and Chekiang combining the Governorship of Fukien; one for Hupei and Hunan combining the Governorship of Hupei; one for Shensi, Kansu,and eventually Sinkiang combining the Governorship of Kansu; one for Kwangtung and Kwangsi combining the Governorship of Kwangtung; one for Yunnan and Kweichow combining the Governorship of Yunnan; and one for Kiangsu, Kiangsi, and Anhwei without a combined Governorship. As in the case of his Ming predecessor, the Governor-general had no authorized official assistants; such agencies as Provincial Administration Commissions (ch’eng-hsüan pu-cheng shih ssu) and Provincial Surveillance Commissions (t’i-hsing an-ch’a shih ssu) provided principal administrative support for both Governors and Governors-general.

Principal operational agents of the Censorate remained Investigating Censors (chien-ch’a yü-shih), restored to rank 7a, distributed among the Province-named Circuits, from 7 to 11 per Circuit, totaling 110 in the mature Ming structure. From 1421 to the end of Ming, a skeletal Censorate also existed among the agencies at Nanking, the auxiliary capital. The Censorate shared with the Ministry of Justice (hsing-pu) and the Court of Judicial Review (ta-li ssu) the collective designation Three Judicial Offices (san fa-ssu). The principal, Vice, and Assistant Censors-in-chief were among the most eminent dignitaries of the central government, and their titles came to be awarded also, as concurrent titles, to the provincial authorities called Grand Coordinators (hsün-fu) and Supreme Commanders (tsung-tu). Investigating Censors, while being under the general administrative jurisdiction of the various Censors-in-chief, were formally identified only with their Circuits, not as members of the Censorate; they reported individually to the Emperor and were popularly known as his “ears and eyes” (t’ien-tzu erh-mu); they were given a great variety of specialized duty assignments, most notably as Province-level Regional Inspectors (hsün-an yü-shih). Investigating Censors and independent Supervising Secretaries (chi-shih-chung) organized in Six Offices of Scrutiny (liu k’o) often collaborated on special investigatory missions and were commonly referred to by such collective designations as k’o-tao (Offices of Scrutiny and Circuits). Ch’ing in general perpetuated the Ming Censorate’s pattern of organization and responsibilities but eliminated Assistant Censors-in-chief, reduced the number of Investigating Censors to 2 to 4 per Province-named Circuit, in 1661 terminated duty assignments as Regional Inspectors, in 1723 formally incorporated the Six Offices of Scrutiny into the Censorate, and made the Censorate the only agency of government in which Manchus and Chinese were appointed in exactly equal numbers to all principal posts - the executive offices, Investigating Censors, and Supervising Censors (a better rendering for post-1723 Supervising Secretaries).","BH: censorate.

Prior to a revolt by the original Princes in 154 B.C., the Princedoms were virtually autonomous; each Prince appointed a staff that replicated the Emperor’s central government, including a Counselor-in-chief (ch’eng-hsiang), a Censor-in-chief (yü-shih ta-fu), Nine Chamberlains (chiu ch’ing), etc.; and each Prince collected and used the revenue from his domain. Such autonomy was stripped away after the revolt was crushed. Thereafter the staff of each Princedom was reduced and was appointed by the central government; and the Princes were deprived of governmental powers in their domains. Each Princedom was managed for the Prince by a court-appointed Administrator (hsiang), with rank at 2,000 bushels equivalent to that of a Commandery Governor (t’ai-shou), assisted principally by an Aide (chang-shih).

In Ch’in and Former Han, from a palace headquarters called the Orchid Pavilion (lan-t’ai), controlled a staff of Attendant Censors (shih yü-shih) who scrutinized all memorials submitted to the throne to ensure that they contained nothing offensive in form or substance, distributed imperial pronouncements to central government agencies,and were sent out to tour units of territorial administration with duty assignment designations such as Supervising Censor (chien yü-shih, chien-ch’a shih) or Commandery-inspecting Censor (chien-chün yü-shih).

In Han ranked 2,000 bushels, in T’ang 3b, in Sung and Chin 2b, in Yüan 1a, in early Ming 1b; 2 appointees common in Sui, Yüan, and early Ming. In Ch’in and Former Han, while being responsible for censorial activities, he was also a general assistant to the Counselor-in-chief (ch’eng-hsiang), to which office he normally succeeded when it fell vacant. In 8 B.C. the post was discontinued and replaced by a Grand Minister of Works (ta ssu-k’ung).

Although most Han censorial titles were patterned after Ch’in antecedents, the name yu-shih t’ai probably originated in Han; thereafter into the early part of the era of N-S Division it was interchangeable with yü-shih fu (lit., Office of Censors); but from Sui into early Ming yü-shih t’ai was the standard name. In the Ming reorganization of the central government in 1380 the name was abolished, to be superseded from 1382 by the name tu ch’a-yüan (lit., chief surveillance bureau). In Yüan the Censorate shared its surveillance responsibilities with 2 Branch Censorates (hsing yü-shih t’ai), dividing China into 3 large surveillance jurisdictions. At times the Censorate had supervisory relationships with regional officials or agencies that imposed more intensive surveillance on local units of administration (especially, e.g., see the Yüan dynasty t’i-hsing an-ch’a shih ssu, Surveillance Commission); and from Ch’in on central government Censors were regularly or irregularly dispatched to tour and inspect units of territorial administration (see chien-ch’a shih, chien yü-shih, yü-shih hsün-an). In Han the censorial organization was headed by a Censor-in-chief (yü-shih ta-fu) until 8 B.C., thereafter by the nominal Palace Aide to the Censor-in-chief (yü-shih chung-ch’eng), ranked at 1,000 bushels and loosely subordinated to the Chamberlain for the Palace Revenues (shao-fu). There was also an Outer Aide to the Censor-in-chief (yü-shih wai-ch’eng) of the same rank, who presumably was a more general assistant to the Censor-in-chief. The principal staff consisted of 45 Attendant Censors (shih yu-shih), rank 600 bushels, of whom 2 were designated Secretarial Censors (chih-shu shih yu-shih) and charged to interpret the laws; 15 of the Attendant Censors were originally assigned to the Palace Aide, and all Attendant Censors were apparently organized in Sections (ts’ao) with some differentiation of functions that is not wholly clear. A principal underling was a Recorder (chu-pu), who seems to have been chief clerk of the agency. The Later Han organization, with the Palace Aide normally serving as active head, was perpetuated through the era of N-S Division. Sui re-established the office of Censor-in-chief with 2 appointees, discontinued the post of Palace Aide, and appointed 2 Secretarial Censors as de facto assistant chiefs of the Censorate. The subordinate censorial staff then consisted of 8 Attendant Censors, 12 Palace Censors (tien-chung shih yü-shih), from 12 to 16 Investigating Censors (chien-ch’a yü-shih), a Recorder, and an Office Manager (lu-shih); ranks are not clear. From T’ang into early Ming the standard organization included one or 2 Censors-in-chief, rank from 3a to 1a; normally 2 Vice Censors-in-chief (yü-shih chung-ch’eng), 5a to 2a; a Headquarters Bureau (t’ai-yüan) staffed with Attendant Censors (discontinued after Sung), a Palace Bureau (tien-yüan) staffed with Palace Censors (tien-chung shih yü-shih), and an Investigation Bureau (ch’a-yüan) staffed with Investigating Censors (chien-ch’a yü-shih).
